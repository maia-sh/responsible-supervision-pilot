However, the merits and limitations of different analysis methods in revealing the underlying physiological feature are not clear. This study aimed to assess these quantitative analysis methods with the support of immunohistological data.",PURPOSE,NA,NA
27379986,2,"Sixteen nude mice bearing xenografted human squamous cell carcinomas (FaDu or CAL-33) were scanned using 2-h dynamic [18F]FMISO PET. Tumors were resected and sliced, and the hypoxia marker pimonidazole was immunostained followed by H&E staining. The pimonidazole signal was segmented using a k-means clustering algorithm, and the hypoxic fraction (HF) was calculated as the hypoxic area/viable tumor-tissue-area ratio pooled over three tissue slices from the apical, center, and basal layers. PET images were analyzed using various methods including static analysis [standard uptake value (SUV), tumor-to-blood ratio (T/B), tumor-to-muscle ratio (T/M)] and kinetic modeling (Casciari αk A , irreversible and reversible two-tissue compartment k 3, Thorwarth w A k 3, Patlak K i , Logan V d , Cho K), and correlated with HF.",PROCEDURES,NA,NA
27379986,3,"No significant correlation was found for static analysis. A significant correlation between k 3 of the irreversible two-tissue compartment model and HF was observed (r = 0.61, p = 0.01). The correlation between HF and αk A of the Casciari model could be improved through reducing local minima by testing more sets of initial values (r = 0.59, p = 0.02) or by reducing the model complexity by fixing three parameters (r = 0.63, p = 0.0008).",RESULTS,NA,NA
27379986,4,"With support of immunohistochemistry data, this study shows that various analysis methods for [18F]FMISO PET perform differently for assessment of tumor hypoxia. A better fitting quality does not necessarily mean a higher physiological correlation. Hypoxia PET analysis needs to consider both the mathematical stability and physiological fidelity. Based on the results of this study, preference should be given to the irreversible two-tissue compartment model as well as the Casciari model with reduced parameters.",CONCLUSIONS,NA,NA

27914956,1,"PET/MR is an emerging hybrid imaging modality. However, attenuation correction (AC) remains challenging for hybrid PET/MR in generating accurate PET images. Segmentation-based methods on special MR sequences are most widely recommended by vendors. However, their accuracy is usually not high. Individual refinement of available certified attenuation maps may be helpful for further clinical applications. In this study, we proposed a multi-resolution regional learning (MRRL) scheme to utilize the internal consistency of the patient data. The anatomical and AC MR sequences of the same subject were employed to guide the refinement of the provided AC maps. The developed algorithm was tested on 9 patients scanned consecutively with PET/MR and PET/CT (7 [18F]FDG and 2 [18F]FET). The preliminary results showed that MRRL can improve the accuracy of segmented attenuation maps and consequently the accuracy of PET reconstructions.",NA,NA,NA
27940128,1,"Resistance to first-line chemotherapies like gemcitabine contributes to high disease lethality in pancreatic cancer. By microarray and qRT-PCR, we observed significant downregulation of microRNA-210 in gemcitabine-resistant cells. The overexpression of microRNA-210 was toxic to gemcitabine-resistant cells and enhanced gemcitabine sensitivity. MicroRNA-210 overexpression induced caspase-3-mediated apoptosis, and inhibited colony formation. Computationally, ABCC5, a highly expressed gene in our array data, was identified as a potential target of microRNA-210 and the overexpression of ABCC5 in gemcitabine-resistant cells was confirmed by qRT-PCR. MicroRNA-210 overexpression reduced ABCC5 mRNA levels and inhibited a luciferase reporter expressing the ABCC5 3' UTR. The expression pattern of microRNA-210 and ABCC5 was mirrored in all of 5 pancreatic cancer cell lines used. Likewise, microRNA-210 transfection nearly totally inhibited tumor xenograft growth, proliferation and metastasis without obvious side effects in vivo. Also, an absence or low expression of microRNA-210 correlated to high ABCC5 expression in the majority of malignant patient tissues from a total of 101 patient tissues examined. Our observations provide at first glance, an important function for microRNA-210 in regulation of gemcitabine responsiveness by it's target gene ABCC5.",NA,NA,NA
28055983,1,"Positron-emission tomography (PET) with hypoxia specific tracers provides a noninvasive method to assess the tumor oxygenation status. Reaction-diffusion models have advantages in revealing the quantitative relation between in vivo imaging and the tumor microenvironment. However, there is no quantitative comparison of the simulation results with the real PET measurements yet. The lack of experimental support hampers further applications of computational simulation models. This study aims to compare the simulation results with a preclinical [18F]FMISO PET study and to optimize the reaction-diffusion model accordingly. Nude mice with xenografted human squamous cell carcinomas (CAL33) were investigated with a 2 h dynamic [18F]FMISO PET followed by immunofluorescence staining using the hypoxia marker pimonidazole and the endothelium marker CD 31. A large data pool of tumor time-activity curves (TAC) was simulated for each mouse by feeding the arterial input function (AIF) extracted from experiments into the model with different configurations of the tumor microenvironment. A measured TAC was considered to match a simulated TAC when the difference metric was below a certain, noise-dependent threshold. As an extension to the well-established Kelly model, a flow-limited oxygen-dependent (FLOD) model was developed to improve the matching between measurements and simulations. The matching rate between the simulated TACs of the Kelly model and the mouse PET data ranged from 0 to 28.1% (on average 9.8%). By modifying the Kelly model to an FLOD model, the matching rate between the simulation and the PET measurements could be improved to 41.2-84.8% (on average 64.4%). Using a simulation data pool and a matching strategy, we were able to compare the simulated temporal course of dynamic PET with in vivo measurements. By modifying the Kelly model to a FLOD model, the computational simulation was able to approach the dynamic [18F]FMISO measurements in the investigated tumors.",NA,NA,NA

Tumor MicroArrays were stained by immunohistochemistry for estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER, PR), HER2, Ki67, CK5/6, CK14, and p63. A pathologist scored all stains and revised morphology and grade. Associations between diabetes/insulin treatment and clinicopathological subtypes were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Morphology and grade were not significantly different between women with diabetes (n = 211) and women without diabetes (n = 101), irrespective of menopausal status.

28229932,1,"The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a multi-protein complex that is highly conserved in eukaryotes. Due to its regulatory impact on processes such as cell cycle, DNA damage response and apoptosis, the CSN is essential for mammalian cells. One of the best-studied functions of the CSN is the deNEDDylation of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) via its catalytically active subunit CSN5/JAB1, thereby triggering the degradation of various target proteins. CSN5 was found to be overexpressed in many human cancer entities, including colon adenocarcinoma. Overactivation of WNT signaling is known as a key step in colon cancer development. Recently, we found that depletion of CSN5 in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells affects WNT signaling by downregulation of β-catenin. To investigate changes in gene expression associated with the CSN5 knockdown, we performed a microarray using cDNA from the CRC cell line SW480. We found the WNT ligand WNT6 and the WNT inhibitors DKK1 and DKK4 differentially regulated in CSN5 knockdown cells. DKK1 expression and DKK1 protein levels depended on CSN5 in different CRC cell lines. In addition, DKK1 secretion was increased following CSN5 knockdown, affecting WNT signaling in SW480 cells. Consequently, blocking of secreted DKK1 in cell-conditioned media abolished β-catenin downregulation in SW480 cells, while treatment with recombinant DKK1 mimicked the CSN5 knockdown effect. Furthermore, knockdown of DKK1 was able to rescue the proliferative deficiency of CSN5 knockdown cells. We conclude that downregulation of WNT signaling in colorectal cancer cells resulting from CSN5 knockdown is mediated, at least in part, by elevated DKK1 secretion. Moreover, experiments with the NEDDylation inhibitor MLN-4924 indicated that DKK1 expression is regulated by a so far unidentified repressor, the stability of which could be controlled by a CSN-regulated CRL.",NA,NA,NA

28292897,1,"Constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 (COP9) signalosome 5 (CSN5), an isopeptidase that removes neural precursor cell-expressed, developmentally down-regulated 8 (NEDD8) moieties from cullins (thus termed ""deNEDDylase"") and a subunit of the cullin-RING E3 ligase-regulating COP9 signalosome complex, attenuates proinflammatory NF-κB signaling. We previously showed that CSN5 is up-regulated in human atherosclerotic arteries. Here, we investigated the role of CSN5 in atherogenesis in vivo by using mice with myeloid-specific Csn5 deletion. Genetic deletion of Csn5 in Apoe-/- mice markedly exacerbated atherosclerotic lesion formation. This was broadly observed in aortic root, arch, and total aorta of male mice, whereas the effect was less pronounced and site-specific in females. Mechanistically, Csn5 KO potentiated NF-κB signaling and proinflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages, whereas HIF-1α levels were reduced. Inversely, inhibition of NEDDylation by MLN4924 blocked proinflammatory gene expression and NF-κB activation while enhancing HIF-1α levels and the expression of M2 marker Arginase 1 in inflammatory-elicited macrophages. MLN4924 further attenuated the expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules in endothelial cells and reduced NF-κB activation and monocyte arrest on activated endothelium in vitro. In vivo, MLN4924 reduced LPS-induced inflammation, favored an antiinflammatory macrophage phenotype, and decreased the progression of early atherosclerotic lesions in mice. On the contrary, MLN4924 treatment increased neutrophil and monocyte counts in blood and had no net effect on the progression of more advanced lesions. Our data show that CSN5 is atheroprotective. We conclude that MLN4924 may be useful in preventing early atherogenesis, whereas selectively promoting CSN5-mediated deNEDDylation may be beneficial in all stages of atherosclerosis.",NA,NA,NA

28592626,1,"Although rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, persistent autoimmune disease, 10 to 15% of RA patients achieve sustained disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-free remission over time. The biological mechanisms underlying the resolution of persistent inflammation in RA are still unidentified, and there is a lack of prognostic markers. It is well established that increased serum levels of gamma interferon-induced protein 10 (IP-10) are associated with (acute) increased inflammatory responses (e.g., in leprosy). In order to assess the potential of IP-10 as a diagnostic tool for inflammatory episodes of RA, we performed a retrospective study and assessed IP-10 levels in longitudinally banked serum samples obtained from patients upon first diagnosis of RA. The selection consisted of 15 persistent RA patients and 19 patients who achieved DMARD-free sustained remission. IP-10 levels, measured by use of a user-friendly quantitative lateral flow assay (LFA), showed up to 170-fold variation interindividually, and baseline IP-10 levels could not be differentiated between the two patient groups. However, a difference in the change in IP-10 levels between the first and last visits (ΔIP-10) was observed (P = 0.003) between DMARD-free (median ΔIP-10, -662 pg/ml [decrease]) and persistent (median ΔIP-10, 468 pg/ml [increase]) RA patients. Moreover, intraindividual changes in IP-10 levels during the course of disease corresponded to the disease activity score (DAS) (P = 0.05). These data indicate that IP-10 is associated with disease activity and perseverance of RA. The association of IP-10 with DAS indicates that this tool may be a practical diagnostic aid to help in monitoring disease progression in RA patients and may also find applications in other chronic diseases with exacerbated inflammatory episodes.",NA,NA,NA

28661798,1,"Despite significant financial, training, and program investments, US children's caries experience and inequities continued to increase over the last 20 years. We posit that (1) dental insurance payment systems are not aligned with the current best evidence, exacerbating inequities, and (2) system redesign could meet health care's triple aim and reduce children's caries by 80%. On the basis of 2013 to 2016 Medicaid and private payment rates and the caries prevention literature, we find that effective preventive interventions are either (1) consistently compensated less than ineffective interventions or (2) not compensated at all. This economic and clinical misalignment may account for underuse of effective caries prevention and subsequent overuse of restorative care. We propose universal school-based comprehensive caries prevention to address this misalignment. Preliminary modeling suggests that universal caries prevention could eliminate 80% of children's caries and cost less than one fifth of current Medicaid children's oral health spending. If implemented with bundled payments based on cycle of care and measurable outcomes, there would be an alignment of incentives, best evidence, care, and outcomes.

28771001,1,"Wheat gluten confers superior baking quality to wheat based products but elicits a pro-inflammatory immune response in patients with celiac disease. Transamidation of gluten by microbial transglutaminase (mTG) and tissue transglutaminase (tTG) reduces the immunogenicity of gluten; however, little information is available on the minimal modification sufficient to eliminate gliadin immunogenicity nor has the effectiveness of transamidation been studied with T-cell clones from patients. Here we demonstrate that mTG can efficiently couple three different acyl-acceptor molecules, l-lysine, glycine ethyl ester, and hydroxylamine, to gliadin peptides and protein. While all three acyl-acceptor molecules were cross-linked to the same Q-residues, not all modifications were equally effective in silencing T-cell reactivity. Finally, we observed that tTG can partially reverse the mTG-catalyzed transamidation by its isopeptidase activity.

28827673,1,"Early detection of leprosy is key to reduce the ongoing transmission. Antibodies directed against M. leprae PGL-I represent a useful biomarker for detecting multibacillary (MB) patients.

Test performance was assessed in independent cohorts originating from three endemic areas. In the Philippine cohort comprising patients with high bacillary indices (BI; average:4,9), 94%(n = 161) of MB patients were identified by UCP-LFA and 78%(n = 133) by Gold-LFA. In the Bangladeshi cohort, including mainly MB patients with low BI (average:1), 41%(n = 14) and 44%(n = 15) were detected by UCP-LFA and Gold-LFA, respectively. In the third cohort of schoolchildren from a leprosy hyperendemic region in Brazil, both tests detected 28%(n = 17) seropositivity. Both rapid tests corresponded well with BI(p < 0.0001), with a fairly higher sensitivity obtained with the UCP-LFA assay. However, due to the spectral character of leprosy, additional, cellular biomarkers are required to detect patients with low BIs.

28981109,1,"Glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone are widely co-prescribed with cytotoxic therapy because of their proapoptotic effects in lymphoid cancer, reduction of inflammation and edema and additional benefits. Concerns about glucocorticoid-induced therapy resistance, enhanced metastasis and reduced survival of patients are largely not considered. We analyzed dexamethasone-induced tumor progression in three established and one primary human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) cell lines and in PDA tissue from patients and xenografts by FACS and western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, MTT and wound assay, colony and spheroid formation, EMSA and in vivo tumor growth and metastasis of tumor xenografts on chicken eggs and mice. Dexamethasone in concentrations observed in plasma of patients favored epithelial-mesenchymal transition, self-renewal potential and cancer progression. Ras/JNK signaling, enhanced expression of TGFβ, vimentin, Notch-1 and SOX-2 and the inhibition of E-cadherin occurred. This was confirmed in patient and xenograft tissue, where dexamethasone induced tumor proliferation, gemcitabine resistance and metastasis. Inhibition of each TGFβ receptor-I, glucocorticoid receptor or JNK signaling partially reversed the dexamethasone-mediated effects, suggesting a complex signaling network. These data reveal that dexamethasone mediates progression by membrane effects and binding to glucocorticoid receptor.",NA,NA,NA
29047142,1,"In metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), liver-limited disease (LLD) is associated with a higher chance of metastectomy leading to long-term survival. However, limited data describes the prognostic and predictive relevance of initially unresectable LLD with regard to targeted first-line therapy. The present analysis investigated the relevance of initially unresectable LLD in mCRC patients treated with targeted therapy against either the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF). The analysis was performed based on FIRE-3, a randomized phase III trial comparing first-line chemotherapy with FOLFIRI plus either cetuximab (anti-EGFR) or bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) in RAS wild-type (WT) mCRC. Of 400 patients, 133 (33.3%) had LLD and 267 (66.8%) had non-LLD. Median overall survival (OS) was significantly longer in LLD compared to non-LLD patients (36.0 vs. 25.4 months; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51-0.87; p = 0.002). In a multivariate analysis also including secondary hepatic resection as time-dependent variable, LLD status was independently prognostic for OS (HR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.50-0.91; p = 0.01). As assessed by interaction tests, treatment benefit from FOLFIRI plus cetuximab compared to FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab was independent of LLD status with regard to objective response rate (ORR), early tumour shrinkage ≥20% (ETS), depth of response (DpR) and OS (all p > 0.05). In conclusion, LLD could be identified as a prognostic factor in RAS-WT mCRC, which was independent of hepatic resection in patients treated with targeted therapy. LLD had no predictive relevance since benefit from FOLFIRI plus cetuximab over bevacizumab was independent of LLD status.",NA,NA,NA
29049388,1,"Mutations in the NPHS2 gene, encoding podocin, cause hereditary nephrotic syndrome. The most common podocin mutation, R138Q, is associated with early disease onset and rapid progression to end-stage renal disease. Knock-in mice carrying a R140Q mutation, the mouse analogue of human R138Q, show developmental arrest of podocytes and lethal renal failure at neonatal age. Here we created a conditional podocin knock-in model named NPHS2 R140Q/-, using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase, which permits to study the effects of the mutation in postnatal life. Within the first week of R140Q hemizygosity induction the animals developed proteinuria, which peaked after 4-5 weeks. Subsequently the animals developed progressive renal failure, with a median survival time of 12 (95% CI: 11-13) weeks. Foot process fusion was observed within one week, progressing to severe and global effacement in the course of the disease. The number of podocytes per glomerulus gradually diminished to 18% compared to healthy controls 12-16 weeks after induction. The fraction of segmentally sclerosed glomeruli was 25%, 85% and 97% at 2, 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. Severe tubulointerstitial fibrosis was present at later disease stage and was correlated quantitatively with the level of proteinuria at early disease stages. While R140Q podocin mRNA expression was elevated, protein abundance was reduced by more than 50% within one week following induction. Whereas miRNA21 expression persistently increased during the first 4 weeks, miRNA-193a expression peaked 2 weeks after induction. In conclusion, the inducible R140Q-podocin mouse model is an auspicious model of the most common genetic cause of human nephrotic syndrome, with a spontaneous disease course strongly reminiscent of the human disorder. This model constitutes a valuable tool to test the efficacy of novel pharmacological interventions aimed to improve podocyte function and viability and attenuate proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and progressive renal failure.",NA,NA,NA

Vaccination coverage data were obtained from various official reports. For the birth cohorts 1903 through 1975, all-cause and cause-specific childhood mortality burden was estimated using restricted mean lifetime survival methods, and a model was used to describe the prevaccination decline in burden.

29143337,1,"Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas has a high risk of progressing to invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), but experimental models for IPMN are largely missing. New experimental systems for the molecular characterization of IPMN and for personalized prognosis and treatment options for IPMN are urgently needed. We analyzed the potential use of fertilized chicken eggs for the culture of freshly resected IPMN tissue. We transplanted 49 freshly resected IPMN tissues into eggs and compared the growth characteristics to IPMN tissues transplanted into mice; this was followed by an analysis of histology, morphology, and marker expression. Of the IPMN tissues transplanted into eggs, 63% formed tumor xenografts within 4 days, while none of the 12 IPMN tissues transplanted into immunodeficient mice engrafted. In the eggs, the grafting efficiency of high-grade (n = 14) and intermediate-grade (n = 17) dysplasia was 77% and was significantly higher than the 39% grafting efficiency of low-grade dysplasia (n = 18). According to mucinous expression, 46 IPMN tissues were classified into gastric (n = 6), intestinal (n = 3), oncocytic (n = 23), and pancreatobiliary (n = 14) subtypes. The grafting efficiency was highest for the pancreatobiliary subtype (86%), followed by the oncocytic (70%), gastric (33%) and intestinal (33%) subtypes. The morphology and expression patterns of mucins, progression markers and pancreatic ductal markers were comparable between the primary IPMN tissues and their xenograft copies.

It is yet unclear which RSfMRI measures are most informative for the individual classification of AD patients. We investigated this using RSfMRI scans from 77 AD patients (MMSE = 20.4 ± 4.5) and 173 controls (MMSE = 27.5 ± 1.8). We calculated i) FC matrices between resting state components as obtained with independent component analysis (ICA), ii) the dynamics of these FC matrices using a sliding window approach, iii) the graph properties (e.g., connection degree, and clustering coefficient) of the FC matrices, and iv) we distinguished five FC states and administered how long each subject resided in each of these five states. Furthermore, for each voxel we calculated v) FC with 10 resting state networks using dual regression, vi) FC with the hippocampus, vii) eigenvector centrality, and viii) the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF). These eight measures were used separately as predictors in an elastic net logistic regression, and combined in a group lasso logistic regression model. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve plots (AUC) to determine classification performance. The AUC values ranged between 0.51 and 0.84 and the highest were found for the FC matrices (0.82), FC dynamics (0.84) and ALFF (0.82). The combination of all measures resulted in an AUC of 0.85.

29162933,1,"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is caused by incomplete repression of the transcription factor DUX4 in skeletal muscle as a consequence of D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat contraction in chromosome 4q35 (FSHD1) or variants in genes encoding D4Z4 chromatin repressors (FSHD2). A clinical hallmark of FSHD is variability in onset and progression suggesting the presence of disease modifiers. A well-known cis modifier is the polymorphic DUX4 polyadenylation signal (PAS) that defines FSHD permissive alleles: D4Z4 chromatin relaxation on non-permissive alleles which lack the DUX4-PAS cannot cause disease in the absence of stable DUX4 mRNA. We have explored the nature and relevance of a common variant of the major FSHD haplotype 4A161, which is defined by 1.6 kb size difference of the most distal D4Z4 repeat unit. While the short variant (4A161S) has been extensively studied, we demonstrate that the long variant (4A161L) is relatively common in the European population, is capable of expressing DUX4, but that DUX4 mRNA processing differs from 4A161S. While we do not find evidence for a difference in disease severity between FSHD carriers of an 4A161S or 4A161L allele, our study does uncover biallelic DUX4 expression in FSHD2 patients. Compared to control individuals, we observed an increased frequency of FSHD2 patients homozygous for disease permissive alleles, and who are thus capable of biallelic DUX4 expression, while SMCHD1 variant carriers with only one permissive allele were significantly more often asymptomatic. This suggests that biallelic DUX4 expression lowers the threshold for disease presentation and is a modifier for disease severity in FSHD2.",NA,NA,NA

29258890,1,"Aging is accompanied by changes in neurotransmission. To advance our understanding of how aging modifies specific neural circuitries, we examined serotonergic and cholinergic stimulation with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) in young and older adults. The instant response to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram (30 mg) and the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor galantamine (8 mg) was measured in 12 young and 17 older volunteers during a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. A powerful dataset consisting of 522 RS-fMRI scans was obtained by acquiring multiple scans per subject before and after drug administration. Group × treatment interaction effects on voxelwise connectivity with ten functional networks were investigated (p < .05, FWE-corrected) using a non-parametric multivariate analysis technique with cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, heart rate and baseline measurements as covariates. Both groups showed a decrease in sensorimotor network connectivity after citalopram administration. The comparable findings after citalopram intake are possibly due to relatively similar serotonergic systems in the young and older subjects. Galantamine altered connectivity between the occipital visual network and regions that are implicated in learning and memory in the young subjects. The lack of a cholinergic response in the elderly might relate to the well-known association between cognitive and cholinergic deterioration at older age.",NA,NA,NA
29264912,1,"Characterization of unknown monoclonal antibody (mAb) variants is important in order to identify their potential impact on safety, potency, and stability. Ion exchange chromatography (IEC) coupled with UV detection is frequently used to separate and quantify mAb variants in routine quality control (QC). However, characterization of the chromatographic peaks resulting from an IEC separation is an extremely time-consuming process, involving many cumbersome steps. Presented here is an online four-dimensional high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (4D HPLC/MS) approach, developed to circumvent these limitations. To achieve this, a 2D HPLC system was extended through the introduction of additional modules, hence enabling fully automated bioseparation of mAbs, fractionation of peaks, reduction, tryptic digestion, and reversed-phase (RP) separation of resulting peptides followed by MS detection. The entire separation and analytical process for an unknown peak is performed in less than 1.5 h, leading to a significant time savings, with comparable sequence coverage.

The purpose of this study was to provide up-to-date estimates for dental expenditures (direct costs) and productivity losses (indirect costs) due to dental diseases on the global, regional, and country level. Direct costs of dental diseases were estimated using a previously established systematic approach; indirect costs were estimated using an approach developed by the World Health Organization Commission on Macroeconomics and Health and factoring in 2015 values for gross domestic product and disability-adjusted life years from the Global Burden of Disease Study.

29362900,1,"Problematic and pathological gambling have emerged as substantial problems in many countries. One potential accelerating factor for this phenomenon during recent years is the Internet, which offers different kinds of games and online applications for gambling that are faster, more attractive due to a variety of design and marketing options, less costly and potentially more addictive than terrestrial gambling opportunities. However, the contributing role of the Internet for problematic gambling has not been analyzed sufficiently so far and remains inconclusive. The current study is based on a representative sample with 15,023 individuals from Germany. With a new concept of assessing online gambling with its relative fraction of total gambling activities and a control-function approach to account for possible endogeneity of online gambling, we estimate the impact of online gambling on gambling behavior while additionally controlling for a rich set of important covariates, like education, employment situation and family status. The results show that, on average, replacing 10% of offline gambling with online gambling increases the likelihood of being a problematic gambler by 8.8-12.6%.

However, modern fixed-bearing designs like the single-radius TKP may provide similar advantages. We compared tibial component migration measured with radiostereometric analysis (RSA) and clinical outcome of otherwise similarly designed cemented fixed-bearing and mobile-bearing single-radius TKPs. Patients and methods - RSA measurements and clinical scores were assessed in 46 randomized patients at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter up to 6 years postoperatively. A linear mixed-effects model was used to analyze the repeated measurements. Results - Both groups showed comparable migration (p = 0.3), with a mean migration at 6-year follow-up of 0.90 mm (95% CI 0.49-1.41) for the fixed-bearing group compared with 1.22 mm (95% CI 0.75-1.80) for the mobile-bearing group. Clinical outcomes were similar between groups. 1 fixed-bearing knee was revised for aseptic loosening after 6 years and 2 knees (1 in each group) were revised for late infection. 2 knees (1 in each group) were suspected for loosening due to excessive migration. Another mobile-bearing knee was revised after an insert dislocation due to failure of the locking mechanism 6 weeks postoperatively, after which study inclusion was preliminary terminated.

29486734,2,"Immunohistochemistry was performed on tumor tissue of 312 women with invasive breast cancer, with or without pre-existing diabetes mellitus, diagnosed in 2000-2010, who were randomly selected from a Danish breast cancer cohort. Women with diabetes were 2:1 frequency matched by year of birth and age at breast cancer diagnosis to those without diabetes. Tumor Microarrays were successfully stained for p-ER, EGFR, p-ERK1/2, p-mTOR, and IGF1R, and scored by a breast pathologist. Associations of expression of these proteins with diabetes, insulin treatment (human insulin and insulin analogues) and other diabetes medication were evaluated by multivariable logistic regression adjusting for menopause and BMI; effect modification by menopausal status, BMI, and ER status was assessed using interactions terms.",METHODS,NA,NA
29486734,3,"We found no significant differences in expression of any of the proteins in breast tumors of women with (n = 211) and without diabetes (n = 101).

29492652,2,Eighteen hemiparetic stroke patients with a severe-to-mild upper limb motor impairment were randomized. Cortico-spinal excitability measures (resting motor thresholds and motor evoked potentials) obtained from a distal (abductor pollicis brevis) and proximal (biceps brachii) upper limb muscle were assessed for both hemispheres. Motor function of the affected hand was tested by the Wolf Motor Function and Action Research Arm tests. The evaluations were performed at baseline and weekly over 7 weeks of in-patient neurological rehabilitation.,METHODS,NA,NA
29492652,3,Severe hand dysfunction was associated with a strong suppression of ipsilesional cortico-spinal excitability and a shift of excitability towards the contralesional hemisphere. Mild hand impairment was associated with a shift of cortico-spinal excitability towards the ipsilesional hemisphere. Favorable motor recovery correlated with an increase of ipsilesional cortico-spinal excitability.,RESULTS,NA,NA
29502397,1,"The concentration of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in serum is used as an early detection method of prostate cancer (PCa); however, it shows low sensitivity, specificity, and a poor predictive value. Initial studies suggested the glycosylation of PSA to be a promising marker for a more specific yet noninvasive PCa diagnosis. Recent studies on the molecular features of PSA glycosylation (such as antenna modification and core fucosylation) were not successful in demonstrating its potential for an improved PCa diagnosis, probably due to the lack of analytical sensitivity and specificity of the applied assays. In this study, we established for the first time a high-performance PSA Glycomics Assay (PGA), allowing differentiation of α2,6- and α2,3-sialylated isomers, the latter one being suggested to be a hallmark of aggressive types of cancer. After affinity purification from urine and tryptic digestion, PSA samples were analyzed by CE-ESI-MS (capillary electrophoresis-electrospray ionization coupled to mass spectrometry). Based on positive controls, an average interday relative standard deviation of 14% for 41 N-glycopeptides was found. The assay was further verified by analyzing PSA captured from patients' urine samples. A total of 67 N-glycopeptides were identified from the PSA pooled from the patients. In summary, the first PGA successfully established in this study allows an in-depth relative quantitation of PSA glycoforms from urine. The PGA is a promising tool for the determination of potential glycomic biomarkers for the differentiation between aggressive PCa, indolent PCa, and benign prostate hyperplasia in larger cohort studies.",NA,NA,NA
29510747,1,"Recent evidence derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies suggests that functional hubs (i.e., highly connected brain regions) are important for mental health. We found recently that global connectivity of a hub in the left frontal cortex (LFC connectivity) is associated with relatively preserved memory abilities and higher levels of protective factors (education, IQ) in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease. These results suggest that LFC connectivity supports reserve capacity, alleviating memory decline. An open question, however, is why LFC connectivity is beneficial and supports memory function in the face of neurodegeneration. We hypothesized that higher LFC connectivity is associated with enhanced efficiency in connected major networks involved in episodic memory. We further hypothesized that higher LFC-related network efficiency predicts higher memory abilities.",BACKGROUND,NA,NA

Using beta-series correlation analysis, we computed task-related LFC connectivity to key memory networks, including the default mode network (DMN) and dorsal attention network (DAN). Network efficiency within the DMN and DAN was estimated by the graph theoretical small-worldness statistic. We applied linear regression analyses to test the association between LFC connectivity with the DMN/DAN and small-worldness of these networks. Mediation analysis was applied to test LFC connectivity to the DMN and DAN as a mediator of the association between education and higher DMN and DAN small-worldness.

29511064,1,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are abundant in mucosal tissues and involved in tissue homeostasis and barrier function. Although several ILC subsets have been identified, it is unknown if additional heterogeneity exists, and their differentiation pathways remain largely unclear. We applied mass cytometry to analyze ILCs in the human fetal intestine and distinguished 34 distinct clusters through a t-SNE-based analysis. A lineage (Lin)-CD7+CD127-CD45RO+CD56+ population clustered between the CD127+ ILC and natural killer (NK) cell subsets, and expressed diverse levels of Eomes, T-bet, GATA3, and RORγt. By visualizing the dynamics of the t-SNE computation, we identified smooth phenotypic transitions from cells within the Lin-CD7+CD127-CD45RO+CD56+ cluster to both the NK cells and CD127+ ILCs, revealing potential differentiation trajectories. In functional differentiation assays, the Lin-CD7+CD127-CD45RO+CD56+CD8a- cells could develop into CD45RA+ NK cells and CD127+RORγt+ ILC3-like cells. Thus, we identified a previously unknown intermediate innate subset that can differentiate into ILC3 and NK cells.",NA,NA,NA
29514134,1,"Survival predictors are of potential use for informing on biological age and targeting prevention of aging-related morbidity. We assessed associations of 2 novel methylomic survival indicators, a methylation-based mortality risk score (MRscore) and the epigenetic clock-derived age acceleration (AA), with a well-known survival predictor, frailty index (FI), and compared the 3 indicators in mortality prediction. In a large population-based cohort with 14-year follow-up, we found both MRscore and AA to be independently associated with FI, but the association was much stronger for MRscore than for AA. Although all 3 indicators were individually associated with all-cause mortality, robust associations only persisted for MRscore and FI when simultaneously including the 3 indicators in regression models, with hazard ratios (95% CI) of 1.91 (1.63-2.22), 1.37 (1.25-1.51), and 1.05 (0.90-1.22), respectively, per standard deviation increase of MRscore, FI, and AA. Prediction error curves, Harrell's C-statistics, and time-dependent AUCs all showed higher predictive accuracy for MRscore than for FI and AA. These findings were validated in independent samples. Our study demonstrates the ability of the MRscore to strongly enhance survival prediction beyond established markers of biological age, such as FI and AA, and it thus bears potential of a surrogate endpoint for clinical research and intervention.",NA,NA,NA
29534768,1,"Vaccination programmes are considered a main contributor to the decline of infectious diseases over the 20th century. In recent years, the national vaccination coverage in the Netherlands has been declining, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and evaluation of vaccination programmes. Our aim was to quantify the impact of long-standing vaccination programmes on notified cases in the Netherlands. We collected and digitised previously unavailable monthly case notifications of diphtheria, poliomyelitis, mumps and rubella in the Netherlands over the period 1919-2015. Poisson regression models accounting for seasonality, multi-year cycles, secular trends and auto-correlation were fit to pre-vaccination periods. Cases averted were calculated as the difference between observed and expected cases based on model projections. In the first 13 years of mass vaccinations, case notifications declined rapidly with 82.4% (95% credible interval (CI): 74.9-87.6) of notified cases of diphtheria averted, 92.9% (95% CI 85.0-97.2) cases of poliomyelitis, and 79.1% (95% CI 67.1-87.4) cases of mumps. Vaccination of 11-year-old girls against rubella averted 49.9% (95% CI 9.3-73.5) of cases, while universal vaccination averted 68.1% (95% CI 19.4-87.3) of cases.

29543531,1,"The inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration-inhibitory factor (MIF) promotes atherosclerosis via lesional monocyte and T-cell recruitment. B cells have emerged as important components in atherogenesis, but the interaction between MIF and B cells in atherogenesis is unknown. Here, we investigated the atherosclerotic phenotype of Mif-gene deletion in Apoe-/- mice. Apoe-/- Mif-/- mice fed a Western diet exhibited strongly reduced atherosclerotic lesions in brachiocephalic artery (BC) and abdominal aorta compared with controls. This phenotype was accompanied by reduced circulating B cells. Flow cytometry revealed a B-cell developmental defect with increased premature and immature B-cell counts in bone marrow (BM) of Apoe-/- Mif-/- mice and diminished B-cell numbers in spleen. This finding was linked with a decreased expression of Baff-R and differentiation-driving transcription factors at the immature B-cell stage, whereas peritoneal B cells exhibited unchanged CD80 and CD86 expression but vastly decreased CD9 and elevated CD23 levels, indicating that the developmental block favors the generation of immature, egressing, and reactive B cells. Mif deficiency did not affect absolute B-cell numbers in the vessel wall but favored a relative increase of B cells in the atheroprone BC region and the appearance of periadventitial B-cell-rich clusters. Of note, Mif-/- mice exhibited a significant increase in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-specific antibodies after the injection of oxLDL, indicating that Mif deficiency is associated with higher sensitivity of B cells against natural-occurring antigens such as oxLDL. Importantly, Apoe-/- mice adoptively transplanted with Apoe-/-Mif-/- BM showed reduced peripheral B cells compared with Apoe-/- BM transplantation but no atheroprotection in the BC; also, whereas there was a selective increase in atheroprotective IgM-anti-oxLDL-antibodies in global Mif deficiency, BM-specific Mif deficiency also led to elevated proatherogenic anti-oxLDL-IgG. Together, these findings reveal a novel link between MIF and B cells in atherogenesis. Protection from atherosclerosis by Mif deficiency is associated with enhanced B-cell hypersensitivity, which in global but not BM-restricted Mif deficiency favors an atheroprotective autoantibody profile in atherosclerotic mice. Targeting MIF may induce protective B-cell responses in atherosclerosis.-Schmitz, C., Noels, H., El Bounkari, O., Straussfeld, E., Megens, R. T.

29582780,1,"Compromises in the design of a positron emission tomography (PET) insert for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system should minimize the deterioration of image quality in both modalities, particularly when simultaneous demanding acquisitions are performed. In this work, the advantages of using individually read-out crystals with high-gain silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) were studied with a small animal PET insert for a 7 T MRI system, in which the SiPM charge was transferred to outside the MRI scanner using coaxial cables. The interferences between the two systems were studied with three radio-frequency (RF) coil configurations. The effects of PET on the static magnetic field, flip angle distribution, RF noise, and image quality of various MRI sequences (gradient echo, spin echo, and echo planar imaging (EPI) at 1H frequency, and chemical shift imaging at 13C frequency) were investigated. The effects of fast-switching gradient fields and RF pulses on PET count rate were studied, while the PET insert and the readout electronics were not shielded. Operating the insert inside a 1H volume coil, used for RF transmission and reception, limited the MRI to T1-weighted imaging, due to coil detuning and RF attenuation, and resulted in significant PET count loss. Using a surface receive coil allowed all tested MR sequences to be used with the insert, with 45-59% signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degradation, compared to without PET. With a 1H/13C volume coil inside the insert and shielded by a copper tube, the SNR degradation was limited to 23-30% with all tested sequences. The insert did not introduce any discernible distortions into images of two tested EPI sequences. Use of truncated sinc shaped RF excitation pulses and gradient field switching had negligible effects on PET count rate. However, PET count rate was substantially affected by high-power RF block pulses and temperature variations due to high gradient duty cycles.",NA,NA,NA
29626112,1,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently incurable, but there is general agreement that a minimally invasive blood biomarker for screening in preclinical stages would be crucial for future therapy. Diagnostic tools for detection of AD are either invasive like cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers or expensive such as positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. Here, we determine the secondary structure change of amyloid-β (Aβ) in human blood. This change used as blood amyloid biomarker indicates prodromal AD and correlates with CSF AD biomarkers and amyloid PET imaging in the cross-sectional BioFINDER cohort. In a further population-based longitudinal cohort (ESTHER), the blood biomarker detected AD several years before clinical diagnosis in baseline samples with a positive likelihood ratio of 7.9; that is, those who were diagnosed with AD over the years were 7.9 times more likely to test positive. This assay may open avenues for blood screening of early AD stages as a funnel for further more invasive and expensive tests.",NA,NA,NA
29627496,1,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has poor therapeutic options. Recent patient studies indicate that cholesterol-lowering statins have anti-tumor capacities. We examined several established and primary PDA and normal cell lines as well as PDA patient tissues (n = 68). We found that simvastatin inhibited viability, stemness, tumor growth and metastasis and that it enhanced the efficacy of gemcitabine. These changes were associated with modulation of Shh-related gene expression. Overexpression of Shh prevented the anti-cancer effect of simvastatin, and inhibition of Shh mimicked the simvastatin effect. In PDA tissues, expression levels of Shh, downstream mediators of Shh and progression markers, namely, cMet, CxCR4 and Vimentin, were lower when patients were prescribed statin medication prior to surgery. These results suggested that statins are cost effective and well-tolerated drugs for prevention and co-treatment of PDA.",NA,NA,NA

29845754,1,"Several studies on hard tissue laser ablation demonstrated that ultrafast lasers enable precise material removal without thermal side effects. Although the principle ablation mechanisms have been thoroughly investigated, there are still open questions regarding the influence of material properties on transient dynamics. In this investigation, we applied pump-probe microscopy to record ablation dynamics of biomaterials with different tensile strengths (dentin, chicken bone, gallstone and kidney stones) at delay times between 1 picosecond and 10 microseconds. Transient reflectivity changes, pressure and shock wave velocities and elastic constants were determined. The result revealed that absorption and excitation show the typical well-known transient behavior of dielectric materials. We observed for all samples a photomechanical laser ablation process, where ultrafast expansion of the excited volume generates pressure waves leading to fragmentation around the excited region. In addition, we identified tensile-strength-related differences in the size of ablated craters and ejected particles. The elastic constants derived were in agreement with literature values. In conclusion, pressure-wave-assisted material removal seems to be a general mechanism for hard tissue ablation with ultrafast lasers. This photomechanical process increases ablation efficiency and removes heated material, thus ultrafast laser ablation is of interest for clinical application where heating of the tissue must be avoided.",NA,NA,NA

The groups were comparable, with mean (SD) age of 7.2 (2.8) years, 32 boys (53.3%) in each group, mean (SD) disease duration of 2.5 (1.5) years and 2.3 (1.7) in the tacrolimus and rituximab groups, respectively, disease duration less than 1 year among 15 children (25.0%) in each group, median (interquartile range) of 4 (3-5) relapses in each group, and mean (SD) cumulative prednisolone dose of 246 (48) mg/kg and 239 (52) mg/kg in the prestudy year in the tacrolimus and rituximab groups, respectively. Rituximab therapy was associated with a higher 12-month relapse-free survival rate than tacrolimus (54 [90.0%] vs 38 [63.3%] children; P < .001; odds ratio, 5.21; 95% CI, 1.93-14.07). Among the patients who experienced relapse, median time to first relapse was 40 weeks in the rituximab group and 29 weeks in the tacrolimus group. Only 2 patients in the rituximab group had more than 1 relapse during the study period compared with 10 patients in the tacrolimus group. The cumulative corticosteroid dose during the 12-month study period was lower with rituximab compared with tacrolimus (mean [SD], 25.8 [27.8] vs 86.3 [58.0] mg/kg). Although both treatments were well tolerated, mild to moderate infections were twice as common in the tacrolimus group (26 [43.3%] vs 13 [21.7%] events).",Results,NA,NA

30149100,1,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be a leading cause of death worldwide with atherosclerosis being the major underlying pathology. The interplay between lipids and immune cells is believed to be a driving force in the chronic inflammation of the arterial wall during atherogenesis. Atherosclerosis is initiated as lipid particles accumulate and become trapped in vessel walls. The subsequent immune response, involving both adaptive and immune cells, progresses plaque development, which may be exacerbated under dyslipidemic conditions. Broad evidence, especially from animal models, clearly demonstrates the effect of lipids on immune cells from their development in the bone marrow to their phenotypic switching in circulation. Interestingly, recent research has also shown a long-lasting epigenetic signature from lipids on immune cells. Traditionally, cardiovascular therapies have approached atherosclerosis through lipid-lowering medications because, until recently, anti-inflammatory therapies have been largely unsuccessful in clinical trials. However, the recent Canakinumab Antiinflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study (CANTOS) provided pivotal support of the inflammatory hypothesis of atherosclerosis in man spurring on anti-inflammatory strategies to treat atherosclerosis. In this review, we describe the interactions between lipids and immune cells along with their specific outcomes as well as discuss their future perspective as potential cardiovascular targets.",NA,NA,NA

Exploiting exogenous variation in the duration of schooling due to 1947 and 1972 reforms in mandatory schooling in the United Kingdom, we examined the causal relationship between education and tooth loss in older age. We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from waves 3 (2006-2007), 5 (2010-2011), and 7 (2014-2015) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. We used a 2-stage least squares instrumental variable approach and included 5,667 respondents (average age = 67.8 years; 44.4% were men) in the analyses, of whom 819 (14.5%) had no teeth. The schooling reforms increased the duration of education by an average of 0.624 years (95% confidence interval: 0.412, 0.835). For respondents born within ±6 years of the pivotal cohorts, a 1-year increment of education causally reduced the probability of edentulism by 9.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.5, 16.8) percentage points. The effects were stronger for the 1947 reform than for the 1972 reform. Results were robust to broadening of the cohort bandwidth and functional form of the cohort trend.

In the current study, each step in this protocol was further optimized. Method improvements included minimizing the extent of side-reaction during derivatization, an adjusted glycan purification strategy and mass analysis of the released N-glycans by ultrahigh resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS.

30239611,1,"White matter alterations are present in the majority of patients with Alzheimer's disease type dementia. However, the spatiotemporal pattern of white matter changes preceding dementia symptoms in Alzheimer's disease remains unclear, largely due to the inherent diagnostic uncertainty in the preclinical phase and increased risk of confounding age-related vascular disease and stroke in late-onset Alzheimer's disease. In early-onset autosomal-dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease, participants are destined to develop dementia, which provides the opportunity to assess brain changes years before the onset of symptoms, and in the absence of ageing-related vascular disease. Here, we assessed mean diffusivity alterations in the white matter in 64 mutation carriers compared to 45 non-carrier family non-carriers. Using tract-based spatial statistics, we mapped the interaction of mutation status by estimated years from symptom onset on mean diffusivity. For major atlas-derived fibre tracts, we determined the earliest time point at which abnormal mean diffusivity changes in the mutation carriers were detectable. Lastly, we assessed the association between mean diffusivity and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of amyloid, tau, phosphorylated-tau, and soluble TREM2, i.e. a marker of microglia activity. Results showed a significant interaction of mutations status by estimated years from symptom onset, i.e. a stronger increase of mean diffusivity, within the posterior parietal and medial frontal white matter in mutation carriers compared with non-carriers. The earliest increase of mean diffusivity was observed in the forceps major, forceps minor and long projecting fibres-many connecting default mode network regions-between 5 to 10 years before estimated symptom onset. Higher mean diffusivity in fibre tracts was associated with lower grey matter volume in the tracts' projection zones. Global mean diffusivity was correlated with lower cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid-β1-42 but higher levels of tau, phosphorylated-tau and soluble TREM2. Together, these results suggest that regionally selective white matter degeneration occurs years before the estimated symptom onset. Such white matter alterations are associated with primary Alzheimer's disease pathology and microglia activity in the brain.",NA,NA,NA
30242109,1,"The bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), a valve with two instead of three aortic leaflets, belongs to the most prevalent congenital heart diseases in the world, occurring in 0.5-2% of the general population. We aimed to understand how changes in early cellular contributions result in BAV formation and impact cardiovascular outflow tract development. Detailed 3D reconstructions, immunohistochemistry and morphometrics determined that, during valvulogenesis, the non-coronary leaflet separates from the parietal outflow tract cushion instead of originating from an intercalated cushion. Nos3-/- mice develop a BAV without a raphe as a result of incomplete separation of the parietal outflow tract cushion into the right and non-coronary leaflet. Genetic lineage tracing of endothelial, second heart field and neural crest cells revealed altered deposition of neural crest cells and second heart field cells within the parietal outflow tract cushion of Nos3-/- embryos. The abnormal cell lineage distributions also affected the positioning of the aortic and pulmonary valves at the orifice level. The results demonstrate that the development of the right and non-coronary leaflets are closely related. A small deviation in the distribution of neural crest and second heart field populations affects normal valve formation and results in the predominant right-non-type BAV in Nos3-/- mice.",NA,NA,NA
30251487,1,"Knowledge of tissue optical properties, in particular the absorption μa and the reduced scattering coefficient μs', is required for diagnostic and therapeutic applications in which the light distribution during treatment has to be known. As it is generally very difficult to obtain this information with sufficient accuracy in vivo, optical properties are often approximately determined on ex vivo tissue samples. In this case, the obtained optical properties may strongly depend on the sample preparation. The extent of the expectable preparation-dependent differences was systematically investigated in comparative measurements on dissected and homogenized porcine tissue samples (liver, lung, brain, and muscle). These measurements were performed at wavelengths 520, 635, 660, and 785 nm, using a dual-step reflectance device and at a spectral range of 515 to 800 nm with an integrating sphere setup. In a third experiment, the density of tissue samples (dissected and homogenized) was investigated, as the characteristic of the packaging of internal tissue structures strongly influences the absorption and scattering. The standard errors of the obtained absorption and reduced scattering coefficients were found to be reduced in case of homogenized tissue. Homogenizing the tissues also allows a much easier and faster sample preparation, as macroscopic internal tissue structures are destroyed in the homogenized tissue so that a planar tissue sample with well-defined thickness can easily and accurately be prepared by filling the tissue paste into a cuvette. Consequently, a better reproducibility result was obtained when using homogenized samples. According to the density measurements accomplished for dissected and homogenized tissue samples, all types of tissues, except lung, showed a decrease in the density due to the homogenization process. The presented results are in good agreement for μs' regardless of the preparation procedure, whereas μa differs, probably influenced by blood content and dehydration. Because of faster and easier preparation and easier sample positioning, homogenization prior to measurement seems to be suitable for investigating the optical properties ex vivo. Additionally, by means of using the homogenization process, the sample size and thickness do not need to be particularly large, as is the case for most biopsies from the OR.",NA,NA,NA
30321321,1,"Medication for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an unmet need. Glucocorticoid (GC) stress hormones drive fat metabolism in the liver, but both full blockade and full stimulation of GC signaling aggravate NAFLD pathology. We investigated the efficacy of selective glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulator CORT118335, which recapitulates only a subset of GC actions, in reducing liver lipid accumulation in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice received a low-fat diet or high-fat diet mixed with vehicle or CORT118335. Livers were analyzed histologically and for genome-wide mRNA expression. Functionally, hepatic long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) composition was determined by gas chromatography. We determined very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) production by treatment with a lipoprotein lipase inhibitor after which blood was collected to isolate radiolabeled VLDL particles and apoB proteins. CORT118335 strongly prevented and reversed hepatic lipid accumulation. Liver transcriptome analysis showed increased expression of GR target genes involved in VLDL production. Accordingly, CORT118335 led to increased lipidation of VLDL particles, mimicking physiological GC action. Independent pathway analysis revealed that CORT118335 lacked induction of GC-responsive genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and LCFA uptake, which was indeed reflected in unaltered hepatic LCFA uptake in vivo. Our data thus reveal that the robust hepatic lipid-lowering effect of CORT118335 is due to a unique combination of GR-dependent stimulation of lipid (VLDL) efflux from the liver, with a lack of stimulation of GR-dependent hepatic fatty acid uptake. Our findings firmly demonstrate the potential use of CORT118335 in the treatment of NAFLD and underscore the potential of selective GR modulation in metabolic disease.",NA,NA,NA

30387838,1,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) such as dexamethasone (DEX) are administered as cancer co‑treatment for palliative purposes due to their pro‑apoptotic effects in lymphoid cancer and limited side effects associated with cancer growth and chemotherapy. However, there is emerging evidence that GCs induce therapy resistance in most epithelial tumors. Our recent data reveal that DEX promotes the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). In the present study, we examined 1 primary and 2 established PDA cell lines, and 35 PDA tissues from patients who had received (n=14) or not received (n=21) GCs prior to surgery. Through microRNA microarray analysis, in silico, and RT‑qPCR analyses, we identified 268 microRNAs differentially expressed between DEX‑treated and untreated cells. With a focus on cancer progression, we selected miR‑132 and its target gene, transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF‑β2), as top candidates. miR‑132 mimics directly bound to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of a TGF‑β2 luciferase construct and enhanced expression, as shown by increased luciferase activity. By contrast, DEX inhibited miR‑132 expression via promoter methylation. miR‑132 mimics also reduced DEX‑induced clonogenicity, migration and expression of vimentin and E‑cadherin in vitro and in tumor xenografts. In patients, GC intake prior to surgery enhanced global hypermethylation and expression of TGF‑β2 in tissues; expression of miR‑132 was detected but could not be quantified. Our results demonstrate that DEX‑mediated inhibition of miR‑132 is a key mediator in the progression of pancreatic cancer, and the findings provide a foundation for miRNA‑based therapies.",NA,NA,NA
30460117,1,"The fragmentation efficiency on Bego artificial stones during lithotripsy and the propulsive effect (via video tracking) was investigated for a variety of laser settings. A variation of the laser settings (pulse energy, pulse duration, repetition rate) altered the total application time required for stone fragmentation, the stone break up time, and the propulsion. The obtained results can be used to develop lithotripsy devices providing an optimal combination of low stone propulsion and high fragmentation efficacy, which can then be evaluated in a clinical setting. Additionally, the fluorescence of human kidney stones was inspected endoscopically in vivo.

30467476,1,"Resting-state fMRI studies demonstrated temporally synchronous fluctuations in brain activity among ensembles of brain regions, suggesting the existence of intrinsic functional networks. A spatial match between some of the resting-state networks and regional brain activation during cognitive tasks has been noted, suggesting that resting-state networks support particular cognitive abilities. However, the spatial match and predictive value of any resting-state network and regional brain activation during episodic memory is only poorly understood. In order to address this research gap, we obtained fMRI acquired both during rest and a face-name association task in 38 healthy elderly subjects. In separate independent component analyses, networks of correlated brain activity during rest or the episodic memory task were identified. For the independent components identified for task-based fMRI, the design matrix of successful encoding or retrieval trials was regressed against the time course of each of the component to identify significantly activated networks. Spatial regression was used to assess the match of resting-state networks against those related to successful memory encoding or retrieval. We found that resting-state networks covering the medial temporal, middle temporal, and frontal areas showed increased activity during successful encoding. Resting-state networks located within posterior brain regions showed increased activity during successful recognition. However, the level of resting-state network connectivity was not predictive of the task-related activity in these networks. These results suggest that a circumscribed number of functional networks detectable during rest become engaged during successful episodic memory. However, higher intrinsic connectivity at rest may not translate into higher network expression during episodic memory.",NA,NA,NA

30529023,1,"Seasonal influenza causes a high disease burden. Many influenza vaccination programmes target the elderly and persons at high risk of complications. Some countries have recommended or even implemented a paediatric vaccination programme. Such a programme is expected to reduce influenza transmission in the population, offering direct protection to the vaccinated children and indirect protection to the elderly. We study the impact of a child vaccination programme with an age- and risk-structured transmission model, calibrated to data of 11 influenza seasons in the Netherlands. The model tracks the build-up of immunes and susceptibles in each age cohort over time, and it allows for seasonal variation in vaccine match and antigenic drift. Different vaccination strategies are evaluated for three target age groups (2-3, 2-12 and 2-16 year olds) over the full range of vaccination coverages (0-100%). The results show that the paediatric vaccination programme has only a limited impact on the elderly age groups, which account for most influenza morbidity and mortality. This is due to two notable changes in infection dynamics. First, an age shift is observed: influenza infections are reduced in vaccinated children, but are increased in young adults with limited natural immunity after years of vaccination. These young adults assume the role of driving the epidemic. Second, a year with low influenza activity can be followed by a large epidemic due to build-up of susceptibles. This variation of the infection attack rate increases with increasing vaccination coverage. The increased variability in the infection attack rate implies that health care facilities should be prepared for rare but larger peaks in influenza patients. Moreover, vaccinating the group with the highest transmission potential, results in a larger dependency on a secure vaccine supply. These arguments should be taken into account in the decision to introduce mass vaccination of school-aged children against influenza.",NA,NA,NA
30530633,1,"During the suckling-to-weaning transition, the intestinal epithelium matures, allowing digestion of solid food. Transplantation experiments with rodent fetal epithelium into subcutaneous tissue of adult animals suggest that this transition is intrinsically programmed and occurs in the absence of dietary or hormonal signals. Here, we show that organoids derived from mouse primary fetal intestinal epithelial cells express markers of late fetal and neonatal development. In a stable culture medium, these fetal epithelium-derived organoids lose all markers of neonatal epithelium and start expressing hallmarks of adult epithelium in a time frame that mirrors epithelial maturation in vivo In vitro postnatal development of the fetal-derived organoids accelerates by dexamethasone, a drug used to accelerate intestinal maturation in vivo Together, our data show that organoids derived from fetal epithelium undergo suckling-to-weaning transition, that the speed of maturation can be modulated, and that fetal organoids can be used to model the molecular mechanisms of postnatal epithelial maturation.",NA,NA,NA
30560920,1,"Leprosy remains persistently endemic in several low- or middle income countries. Transmission is still ongoing as indicated by the unabated rate of leprosy new case detection, illustrating the insufficiency of current prevention methods. Therefore, low-complexity tools suitable for large scale screening efforts to specifically detect M. leprae infection and diagnose disease are required. Previously, we showed that combined detection of cellular and humoral markers, using field-friendly lateral flow assays (LFAs), increased diagnostic potential for detecting leprosy in Bangladesh compared to antibody serology alone. In the current study we assessed the diagnostic performance of similar LFAs in three other geographical settings in Asia, Africa and South-America with different leprosy endemicity. Levels of anti-PGL-I IgM antibody (humoral immunity), IP-10, CCL4 and CRP (cellular immunity) were measured in blood collected from leprosy patients, household contacts and healthy controls from each area. Combined detection of these biomarkers significantly improved the diagnostic potential, particularly for paucibacillary leprosy in all three regions, in line with data obtained in Bangladesh.

Little is known about the extent to which expectations influence outcomes of treatments in the field of appetite regulation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of treatment-related expectations on subjective and objective markers of appetite. Methods: 90 healthy participants of normal weight were randomly allocated to either an appetite-enhancing placebo group, a satiety-enhancing placebo group, or a control group. All participants received a placebo capsule along with group-specific verbal suggestions to either be appetite-promoting, or satiety-enhancing, or to have no effect on appetite. Before and during the 2 h following randomization, participants were repeatedly asked to rate feelings of hunger and satiety on visual analog scales (VAS), and blood samples were taken repeatedly to assess plasma ghrelin levels as a physiological marker of hunger. Results: In comparison to the control group, the satiety-enhancing placebo intervention significantly reduced appetite and increased satiety. The appetite-enhancing placebo intervention did not alter subjective levels of hunger, but increased plasma ghrelin levels in females.

Emergency treatments are more frequently needed, and many patients develop permanent facial weakness and nasal speech. Therefore, new treatment options would be welcome. The neonatal Fc receptor protects IgG from lysosomal breakdown, thus prolonging IgG serum half-life. Neonatal Fc receptor antagonism lowers serum IgG levels and thus may act therapeutically in autoantibody-mediated disorders. In MuSK MG, IgG4 anti-MuSK titres closely correlate with disease severity. We therefore tested efgartigimod (ARGX-113), a new neonatal Fc receptor blocker, in a mouse model for MuSK myasthenia gravis. This model involves 11 daily injections of purified IgG4 from MuSK myasthenia gravis patients, resulting in overt myasthenic muscle weakness and, consequently, body weight loss. Daily treatment with 0.5 mg efgartigimod, starting at the fifth passive transfer day, reduced the human IgG4 titres about 8-fold, despite continued daily injection. In muscle strength and fatigability tests, efgartigimod-treated myasthenic mice outperformed control myasthenic mice. Electromyography in calf muscles at endpoint demonstrated less myasthenic decrement of compound muscle action potentials in efgartigimod-treated mice. These substantial in vivo improvements of efgartigimod-treated MuSK MG mice following a limited drug exposure period were paralleled by a tendency of recovery at neuromuscular synaptic level (in various muscles), as demonstrated by ex vivo functional studies. These synaptic improvements may well become more explicit upon longer drug exposure. In conclusion, our study shows that efgartigimod has clear therapeutic potential in MuSK myasthenia gravis and forms an exciting candidate drug for many autoantibody-mediated neurological and other disorders.",NA,NA,NA

30914076,1,"IntroductionWith growing amounts of data available, identification of clusters of persons linked to each other by transmission of an infectious disease increasingly relies on automated algorithms. We propose cluster finding to be a two-step process: first, possible transmission clusters are identified using a cluster algorithm, second, the plausibility that the identified clusters represent genuine transmission clusters is evaluated.AimTo introduce visual tools to assess automatically identified clusters.MethodsWe developed tools to visualise: (i) clusters found in dimensions of time, geographical location and genetic data; (ii) nested sub-clusters within identified clusters; (iii) intra-cluster pairwise dissimilarities per dimension; (iv) intra-cluster correlation between dimensions. We applied our tools to notified mumps cases in the Netherlands with available disease onset date (January 2009 - June 2016), geographical information (location of residence), and pathogen sequence data (n = 112). We compared identified clusters to clusters reported by the Netherlands Early Warning Committee (NEWC).ResultsWe identified five mumps clusters. Three clusters were considered plausible. One was questionable because, in phylogenetic analysis, genetic sequences related to it segregated in two groups. One was implausible with no smaller nested clusters, high intra-cluster dissimilarities on all dimensions, and low intra-cluster correlation between dimensions. The NEWC reports concurred with our findings: the plausible/questionable clusters corresponded to reported outbreaks; the implausible cluster did not.ConclusionOur tools for assessing automatically identified clusters allow outbreak investigators to rapidly spot plausible transmission clusters for mumps and other human-to-human transmissible diseases.

30922146,1,"Background Inability to tolerate statins because of muscle symptoms contributes to uncontrolled cholesterol levels and insufficient cardiovascular risk reduction. Bempedoic acid, a prodrug that is activated by a hepatic enzyme not present in skeletal muscle, inhibits ATP -citrate lyase, an enzyme upstream of β-hydroxy β-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Methods and Results The phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled CLEAR (Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic acid, an ACL-Inhibiting Regimen) Serenity study randomized 345 patients with hypercholesterolemia and a history of intolerance to at least 2 statins (1 at the lowest available dose) 2:1 to bempedoic acid 180 mg or placebo once daily for 24 weeks. The primary end point was mean percent change from baseline to week 12 in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The mean age was 65.2 years, mean baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 157.6 mg/dL, and 93% of patients reported a history of statin-associated muscle symptoms. Bempedoic acid treatment significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from baseline to week 12 (placebo-corrected difference, -21.4% [95% CI, -25.1% to -17.7%]; P<0.001). Significant reductions with bempedoic acid versus placebo were also observed in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-17.9%), total cholesterol (-14.8%), apolipoprotein B (-15.0%), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (-24.3%; P<0.001 for all comparisons). Bempedoic acid was safe and well tolerated. The most common muscle-related adverse event, myalgia, occurred in 4.7% and 7.2% of patients who received bempedoic acid or placebo, respectively.

30934833,1,"Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)-mediated signaling in the brain has been suggested as a protective factor in the development of psychopathology, in particular mood disorders. We recently identified genomic loci at which either MR or the closely related glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binds selectively, and found members of the NeuroD transcription factor family to be specifically associated with MR-bound DNA in the rat hippocampus. We show here using forebrain-specific MR knockout mice that GR binding to MR/GR joint target loci is not affected in any major way in the absence of MR. Neurod2 binding was also independent of MR binding. Moreover, functional comparison with MyoD family members indicates that it is the chromatin remodeling aspect of NeuroD, rather than its direct stimulation of transcription, that is responsible for potentiation of MR-mediated transcription. These findings suggest that NeuroD acts in a permissive way to enhance MR-mediated transcription, and they argue against competition for DNA binding as a mechanism of MR- over GR-specific binding.",NA,NA,NA

31017513,1,"Background and purpose - Pooling data of studies evaluating total knee arthroplasty migration using radiostereometric analysis (RSA) may be compromised when the RSA method used would influence estimated differences between groups. We therefore reanalyzed a marker-based RSA study with model-based RSA to assess possible limitations of each RSA method, including insert micromotions in modular TKA and their effect on estimated group differences. Patients and methods - All patients had received a cemented Triathlon implant (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ, USA) with either an all-polyethylene (n = 29) or a metal-backed (n = 28) tibial component. The latter group was reanalyzed with model-based RSA. Precision of each RSA method was calculated using double examinations. Bland-Altman plots were constructed to determine the limits of agreement between the 2 RSA methods. Polyethylene insert micromotion was quantified by measuring migration with respect to the metal tray. Finally, analyses of the original study were repeated with the model-based RSA results. Results - Systematic differences were found in translations between marker-based and model-based RSA as a result of different reference origins being used for migration calculations. Micromotions of the polyethylene insert within the metal tray were negligibly small. Mean migration results were comparable between marker-based and model-based RSA when using the same reference origin, even though conclusions on individual patients may differ between RSA methods due to various types of measurement error (e.g., marker occlusion and model-fit inaccuracies). Interpretation - At least for the studied TKA design, pooling mean migration data of different RSA methods appears justified. For translations, however, adjustments should be made to correct for differences in reference origin. Migration patterns of individual patients may differ as a result of distinct types of measurement error.",NA,NA,NA

31112788,1,"Disruption of cholinergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter systems is associated with cognitive, emotional and behavioural symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate the responsiveness of these systems in AD we measured the effects of a single-dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor galantamine in 12 patients with AD and 12 age-matched controls on functional brain connectivity with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. In this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, functional magnetic resonance images were repeatedly obtained before and after dosing, resulting in a dataset of 432 scans. Connectivity maps of ten functional networks were extracted using a dual regression method and drug vs. placebo effects were compared between groups with a multivariate analysis with signals coming from cerebrospinal fluid and white matter as covariates at the subject level, and baseline and heart rate measurements as confound regressors in the higher-level analysis (at p < 0.05, corrected). A galantamine induced difference between groups was observed for the cerebellar network. Connectivity within the cerebellar network and between this network and the thalamus decreased after galantamine vs. placebo in AD patients, but not in controls. For citalopram, voxelwise network connectivity did not show significant group × treatment interaction effects. However, we found default mode network connectivity with the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex to be increased in AD patients, which could not be detected within the control group. Further, in contrast to the AD patients, control subjects showed a consistent reduction in mean connectivity with all networks after administration of citalopram. Since AD has previously been characterized by reduced connectivity between the default mode network and the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex, the effects of citalopram on the default mode network suggest a restoring potential of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in AD. The results of this study also confirm a change in cerebellar connections in AD, which is possibly related to cholinergic decline.",NA,NA,NA
31121060,1,"Brain mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) respond to the same glucocorticoid hormones but can have differential effects on cellular function. Several lines of evidence suggest that MR-specific target genes must exist and might underlie the distinct effects of the receptors. The present study aimed to identify MR-specific target genes in the hippocampus, a brain region where MR and GR are co-localised and play a role in the stress response. Using genome-wide binding of both receptor types, we previously identified MR-specific, MR-GR overlapping and GR-specific putative target genes. We now report altered gene expression levels of such genes in the hippocampus of forebrain MR knockout (fbMRKO) mice, killed at the time of their endogenous corticosterone peak. Of those genes associated with MR-specific binding, the most robust effect was a 50% reduction in Jun dimerization protein 2 (Jdp2) mRNA levels in fbMRKO mice. Down-regulation was also observed for the MR-specific Nitric oxide synthase 1 adaptor protein (Nos1ap) and Suv3 like RNA helicase (Supv3 l1). Interestingly, the classical glucocorticoid target gene FK506 binding protein 5 (Fkbp5), which is associated with MR and GR chromatin binding, was expressed at substantially lower levels in fbMRKO mice. Subsequently, hippocampal Jdp2 was confirmed to be up-regulated in a restraint stress model, posing Jdp2 as a bona fide MR target that is also responsive in an acute stress condition. Thus, we show that MR-selective DNA binding can reveal functional regulation of genes and further identify distinct MR-specific effector pathways.",NA,NA,NA

31140754,1,"Although having shown promising clinical outcomes, the effectiveness of 5-aminolevulinic acid-based photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and glioblastoma remains to be improved. The analgesic drug methadone is able to sensitize various tumors to chemotherapy. In this in vitro study, the influence of methadone to the effectiveness of ALA-PDT for SCC (FADU) and glioblastoma (A172) was investigated on the protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence, survival rates, apoptosis, and cell cycle phase, each with or without the presence of methadone. The production of PpIX was increased by methadone in FADU cells while it was decreased in A172 cells. The survival rates of both cell lines treated by ALA-PDT were significantly reduced by the combination with methadone (P < .05). Methadone also significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells and improved the effect of ALA-PDT on the cell cycle phase arrest in the G0/G1 phase (P < .05). This study demonstrates the potential of methadone to influence the cytotoxic effect of ALA-PDT for both SCC and glioblastoma cell lines.",NA,NA,NA
31163053,1,"Underreporting of alcohol consumption is one of the major challenges in survey research including self-reports. The aim of this study was to test whether underreporting can be reduced by prompting respondents to first reflect on their drinking in the past week and then answer quantity-frequency based screening questions on their typical alcohol use. Data come from 2,379 adults (54% female; mean age = 31.8 years, SD = 11.4 years) consecutively recruited at a local registration office in northeastern Germany. Participants responded to an electronic, self-administered questionnaire on different health behaviors. They were randomized to receiving the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) either before or after the assessment of past week timeline follow-back questions. Logistic regression models were calculated predicting positive screening results for at-risk drinking. Potential interaction effects with gender, age and educational background were explored. Results show that the assessment of past week alcohol consumption prior to the assessment of the AUDIT-C reduced the odds of obtaining positive screening results (OR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.70-0.99). There were no interaction effects with gender, age and educational background. As a secondary finding, participants reported consistently lower alcohol consumption in the alcohol measure that was administered later in the questionnaire. Preceding questions about alcohol consumption in the past week reduced the probability of positive screening results for at-risk drinking. Our findings suggest that prompting people to recall past week alcohol use prior to screening may not be a solution to reduce underreporting.",NA,NA,NA

Broccoli sulforaphane is a promising new treatment due to the results of recent epidemiological, experimental and patient studies. Upon approval from the ethics committee and registration at ClinicalTrials.gov, 40 patients with palliative chemotherapy were placed into a placebo and treatment group in an unblinded fashion. Fifteen capsules with pulverized broccoli sprouts containing 90 mg/508 μmol sulforaphane and 180 mg/411 μmol glucoraphanin or methylcellulose were administered daily for up to 1 year. Twenty-nine patients were included in the treatment group and 11 patients were in the placebo group; these patients were followed for up to 1 year. The patient characteristics, overall survival and feasibility were assessed. Compared to those of the placebo group, the mean death rate was lower in the treatment group during the first 6 months after intake (day 30: 0%/18%, day 90: 0%/25%, and day 180: 25%/43%), and Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a higher survival rate. There was a high drop-out rate (72% in the treatment group and 55% in the placebo group) after 1 year. We concluded from the Karnofsky index that the broccoli sprouts did not impact patient's self-care and overall abilities severely. The intake of 15 capsules daily was difficult for some patients, and the broccoli sprouts sometimes increased digestive problems, nausea and emesis.

31306369,1,"The quantification of the effect of pharmacological treatment on the cardiovascular system is complicated because of the high level of interindividual and circadian variability. Recently, a dopamine-somatostatin chimera, BIM23B065, was under investigation to concurrently target the somatostatin and dopamine D2 receptors for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. However, both dopamine and somatostatin interact with different components of the cardiovascular system. This study established the response of the heart rate and the systolic blood pressure after administration of BIM23B065 in healthy male volunteers by analysis of the rate-pressure product (RPP), in a model-informed analysis. The RPP in the supine position of placebo-treated subjects showed a clear circadian component, best described by 2 cosine functions. The pharmacokinetics of BIM23B065 and its metabolite were best described using 2-compartment models with different forms of elimination kinetics. The administration of BIM23B065 gave a statistically significant reduction in the RPP, after which the effect diminished because of the tolerance to the cardiovascular effects after prolonged exposure to BIM23B065. This model provided insight in the circadian rhythm of the RPP in the supine position and the level of interindividual variability in healthy male volunteers. The developed population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model quantified the interaction between BIM23B065 and the RPP, informing on the clinical pharmacological properties of BIM23B065.",NA,NA,NA

Here, we present a first comprehensive site-specific N- and O-glycosylation characterization of atacicept using mass spectrometry-based workflows. First, N- and O-glycosylation sites and their corresponding glycoforms were identified. Second, a relative quantitation of the N-glycosylation site microheterogeneity was achieved by glycopeptide analysis, which was further supported by analysis of the released N-glycans. We confirmed the presence of one N-glycosylation site, carrying 47 glycoforms covering 34 different compositions, next to two hinge region O-glycosylation sites with core 1-type glycans.

31376284,1,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is considered as principal cause of gastric cancer. It is further associated with a reduced risk of esophageal adenocarcinomas. In a large prospective population-based cohort study including 9,949 subjects with average observation time of 13.8 years, we assessed the risk of invasive gastric and esophageal cancer according to H. pylori infection and presence of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). Incidence rates and hazard ratios (HR) derived by Cox proportional hazards models and adjusted for relevant confounders were derived by seroprevalence of H. pylori and cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) antibodies and presence of CAG based on serological markers at baseline, respectively. During follow-up, 30 cases of noncardia gastric cancer and 33 cases of esophageal cancer were observed. Infection by H. pylori without and with expression of CagA was associated with a 5.2-fold (95% confidence interval 1.00-27.1) and an 18.2-fold (4.3-77.4) increase of noncardia gastric cancer incidence. A 0.65-fold decreased risk of esophageal adenocarcinomas (HR 0.35, 0.12-0.97) was observed among H. pylori-infected individuals.

31391470,1,"Children with chronic kidney disease suffer from excessive cardiovascular mortality and early alterations of the cardiovascular system. Tissue doppler imaging is a validated echocardiographic tool to assess early systolic and diastolic cardiac dysfunction. We hypothesized that tissue Doppler velocities would reveal reduced cardiac function in children with chronic kidney disease compared to healthy children. A standardized echocardiographic exam was performed in 128 patients of the Cardiovascular Comorbidity in Children with Chronic Kidney Disease (4C) Study aged 6-17 years with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Tissue Doppler measurements included early (E') and late (A') diastolic and systolic (S') velocity at the mitral and septal annulus of the left ventricle. Measured values were normalized to z-scores using published reference data. Predictors of E'/A', E/E', S' and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were assessed by multiple linear regression analyses. Tissue Doppler E' was reduced and tissue Doppler A' increased, resulting in a reduced tissue Doppler E'/A' ratio (z-score -0.14, p < 0.0001) indicating reduced diastolic function compared to healthy children. Reduced tissue Doppler E'/A' Z-Scores were independently associated with lower eGFR (p = 0.002) and increased systolic blood pressure (p = 0.02). While E/E' Z-Scores were increased (Z-score 0.57, p < 0.0001), patients treated with pharmacological RAS blockade but not with other antihypertensive treatments had significantly lower E/E' and higher E'/A' Z-Scores. Systolic tissue Doppler velocities were significantly decreased (Z-score -0.24, p = 0.001) and inversely correlated with E/E' Z-Scores (r = -0.41, p < 0.0001). LVMI was not associated with systolic or diastolic tissue Doppler velocities. Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy showed a tendency to lower S' in multivariate analysis (p = 0.13) but no association to diastolic function. Concentric left ventricular geometry was significantly associated with lower midwall fractional shortening. In summary, systolic and diastolic function assessed by tissue Doppler is impaired. eGFR, systolic blood pressure and the type of antihypertensive medications are significant predictors of diastolic function in children with CKD. Left ventricular morphology is largely independent of tissue Doppler velocities. Tissue Doppler velocities provide sensitive information about early left ventricular dysfunction in this population.",NA,NA,NA

In a single experimental session, 20 female TTC patients and 20 age matched (mean age 61.5 years, ± 12.89) catheter-confirmed heart-healthy women were examined. Saline solution was administered three times i.v. to all participants, with the verbal suggestion they receive an inert substance with no effects on the heart (neutral condition), a drug that would support cardiac functions (positive condition), and a drug that would burden the heart (negative condition). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (DBP/SBP), heart rate (HR), endocrine markers cortisol (µg/dl), copeptin (pmol/l), and subjective stress ratings (SUD) were assessed to examine alterations of the SNS and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). Before and after each intervention SUD was rated. One pre and three post serum cortisol and copeptin samples were assessed, and a long-term electrocardiogram as well as non-invasive, continuous blood pressure was recorded. The study design elucidated a significant increase of SUD levels as a response to the nocebo intervention, while perceived stress remained unaffected during the preceding neutral and positive interventions. Increasing SUD levels were accompanied by higher SBP and an anticipatory increase of HR shortly prior to the nocebo intervention. SBP increased also as a response to positive verbal suggestions (Bonferroni-corrected p-values > .05). Alterations of cortisol and copeptin due to the interventions and significant placebo effects failed to appear. Interestingly no differences between TCC patients and controls could be found.These findings do not support the assumption of an exaggerated activation of the SNS as a discriminatory factor for TTC.

31428975,1,"PET (positron emission tomography) biokinetic modelling relies on accurate quantitative data. One of the main corrections required in PET imaging to obtain high quantitative accuracy is tissue attenuation correction (AC). Incorrect non-uniform PET-AC may result in local bias in the emission images, and thus in relative activity distributions and time activity curves for different regions. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)-based AC is an active area of research in PET/MRI neuroimaging, where several groups developed in the last few years different methods to calculate accurate attenuation (μ-)maps. Some AC methods have been evaluated for different PET radioisotopes and pathologies. However, AC in PET/MRI has scantly been investigated in dynamic PET studies where the aim is to get quantitative kinetic parameters, rather than semi-quantitative parameters from static PET studies. In this work, we investigated the impact of AC accuracy in PET image absolute quantification and, more importantly, in the slope of the Patlak analysis based on the simplified reference tissue model, from a dynamic [18F]-fluorodopa (FDOPA) PET/MRI study. In the study, we considered the two AC methods provided by the vendor and an in-house AC method based on the dual ultrashort time echo MRI sequence, using as reference a multi-atlas-based AC method based on a T1-weighted MRI sequence.",BACKGROUND,NA,NA
31428975,2,"Non-uniform bias in absolute PET quantification across the brain, from - 20% near the skull to - 10% in the central region, was observed using the two vendor's μ-maps. The AC method developed in-house showed a - 5% and 1% bias, respectively. Our study resulted in a 5-9% overestimation of the PET kinetic parameters with the vendor-provided μ-maps, while our in-house-developed AC method showed < 2% overestimation compared to the atlas-based AC method, using the cerebellar cortex as reference region. The overestimation obtained using the occipital pole as reference region resulted in a 7-10% with the vendor-provided μ-maps, while our in-house-developed AC method showed < 6% overestimation.",RESULTS,NA,NA
31428975,3,"PET kinetic analyses based on a reference region are especially sensitive to the non-uniform bias in PET quantification from AC inaccuracies in brain PET/MRI. Depending on the position of the reference region and the bias with respect to the analysed region, kinetic analyses suffer different levels of bias. Considering bone in the μ-map can potentially result in larger errors, compared to the absence of bone, when non-uniformities in PET quantification are introduced.",CONCLUSIONS,NA,NA
31443329,1,"Severe streptococcal infections are commonly treated with intravenous followed by oral penicillin (pheneticillin) therapy. However, switching from iv to oral therapy is complicated by the variability in oral pheneticillin absorption. We employed an Oral Absorption Test (OAT) for pheneticillin to identify patients in whom oral pheneticillin absorption is poor. Out of 84 patients 30 patients (36%) were identified as insufficient absorbers. Treatment failure due to pheneticillin malabsorption can be avoided by performing an OAT, and these patients should be treated by another antibiotic, which is known to be absorbed well.",NA,NA,NA
31450448,1,"Body fluid N-glycome analysis as well as glyco-proteoform profiling of existing protein biomarkers potentially provides a stratification layer additional to quantitative, diagnostic protein levels. For clinical omics applications, the collection of a dried blood spot (DBS) is increasingly pursued as an alternative to sampling milliliters of peripheral blood. Here we evaluate DBS cards as a blood collection strategy for protein N-glycosylation analysis aiming for high-throughput clinical applications. A protocol for facile N-glycosylation profiling from DBS is developed that includes sialic acid linkage differentiation. This protocol is based on a previously established total plasma N-glycome mass spectrometry (MS) method, with adjustments for the analysis of DBS specimens. After DBS-punching and protein solubilization N-glycans are released, followed by chemical derivatization of sialic acids and MS-measurement of N-glycan profiles. With this method, more than 80 different glycan structures are identified from a DBS, with RSDs below 10% for the ten most abundant glycans. N-glycan profiles of finger-tip blood and venous blood are compared and short-term stability of DBS is demonstrated. This method for fast N-glycosylation profiling of DBS provides a minimally invasive alternative to conventional serum and plasma protein N-glycosylation workflows. With simplified blood sampling this DBS approach has vast potential for clinical glycomics applications.",NA,NA,NA
31462511,1,"Loss of function of TREM2, a key receptor selectively expressed by microglia in the brain, contributes to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We therefore examined whether soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were associated with reduced rates of cognitive decline and clinical progression in subjects with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We measured sTREM2 in CSF samples from 385 elderly subjects, including cognitively normal controls, individuals with MCI, and subjects with AD dementia (follow-up period: mean, 4 years; range 1.5 to 11.5 years). In subjects with AD defined by evidence of CSF Aβ1-42 (amyloid β-peptide 1 to 42; A+) and CSF p-tau181 (tau phosphorylated on amino acid residue 181; T+), higher sTREM2 concentrations in CSF at baseline were associated with attenuated decline in memory and cognition. When analyzed in clinical subgroups, an association between higher CSF sTREM2 concentrations and subsequent reduced memory decline was consistently observed in individuals with MCI or AD dementia, who were positive for CSF Aβ1-42 and CSF p-tau181 (A+T+). Regarding clinical progression, a higher ratio of CSF sTREM2 to CSF p-tau181 concentrations predicted slower conversion from cognitively normal to symptomatic stages or from MCI to AD dementia in the subjects who were positive for CSF Aβ1-42 and CSF p-tau181. These results suggest that sTREM2 is associated with attenuated cognitive and clinical decline, a finding with important implications for future clinical trials targeting the innate immune response in AD.",NA,NA,NA
31474997,1,"The human fetal immune system must protect the infant against the sudden exposure to a large variety of pathogens upon birth. While it is known that the fetal immune system develops in sequential waves, relatively little is known about the composition of the innate and adaptive immune system in the tissues. Here, we applied high-dimensional mass cytometry to profile the immune system in human fetal liver, spleen, and intestine. With Hierarchical Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (HSNE) we distinguished 177 distinct immune cell clusters, including both previously identified and novel cell clusters. PCA analysis indicated substantial differences between the compositions of the immune system in the different organs. Through dual t-SNE we identified tissue-specific cell clusters, which were found both in the innate and adaptive compartment. To determine the spatial location of tissue-specific subsets we developed a 31-antibody panel to reveal both the immune compartment and surrounding stromal elements through analysis of snap-frozen tissue samples with imaging mass cytometry. Imaging mass cytometry reconstructed the tissue architecture and allowed both the characterization and determination of the location of the various immune cell clusters within the tissue context. Moreover, it further underpinned the distinctness of the immune system in the tissues. Thus, our results provide evidence for early compartmentalization of the adaptive and innate immune compartment in fetal spleen, liver, and intestine. Together, our data provide a unique and comprehensive overview of the composition and organization of the human fetal immune system in several tissues.",NA,NA,NA

31488385,1,"The distribution of muscle weakness in myasthenia gravis (MG) patients with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies is highly variable. As muscle groups respond differently to therapeutic interventions, it is important to acknowledge this variability. We analysed the distribution of muscle weakness in 225 AChR MG patients over time. On the basis of combinations of muscle weakness, seven phenotypes were defined: 'ocular' (O), 'bulbar' (B), 'neck/limbs/respiratory' (NLR), or a combination (O+B, O+NLR, B+NLR and O+B+NLR). MG remained restricted to ocular weakness in 5%, whereas 7% never had ocular weakness. At last follow-up, ocular or bulbar weakness had resolved more frequently than NLR weakness (40%, 38% and 25%; p = 0.003, respectively). Patients with O, B or OB phenotype at baseline had a higher age at onset and were more frequently male than patients with NLR, ONLR, BNLR or OBNLR phenotype (52.7 ± 17.5 vs. 44.0 ± 18.9; p = 0.007 and 64% vs. 37%; p = 0.002, respectively). MG patients have heterogeneous distributions of muscle weakness and frequently shift between phenotypes. The phenotypic variations found in AChR MG suggest that also other factors aside from the AChR antibody mediated immune response are of importance in determining the disease expression in MG.",NA,NA,NA

Currently there is no internationally accepted definition for quality of oral healthcare. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to establish a working definition for quality of oral healthcare that would help to advance further improvements in the field of quality improvement in oral healthcare. The development of the working definition included a 3-step approach: 1) literature screening; 2) expert-based compilation of an initial list of topics, leaning on the National Academy of Medicine framework for quality of care; and 3) a World Café with voting, which took place during the annual general meeting of the International Association for Dental Research in 2018. Following this approach, the collective intelligence of involved participants yielded a comprehensive list of items, prioritized by relevance. The resulting working definition comprises 7 domains—patient safety, effectiveness, efficiency, patient-centeredness, equitability, timeliness, access to care—and 30 items, which together characterize quality of oral healthcare.

31601999,1,"Transdermal fentanyl is widely used to control pain in cancer patients. The high pharmacokinetic variability of fentanyl is assumed to be due to cytochrome P450 3A-mediated (CYP3A) N-dealkylation to norfentanyl in humans. However, recently published clinical studies question the importance of the described metabolic pathway. In this small study in palliative cancer patients under real-life clinical conditions, the influence of CYP3A on fentanyl variability was investigated. In addition to the determination of midazolam plasma concentration to reveal CYP3A activity, plasma concentrations of fentanyl and its metabolite, norfentanyl, were measured in identical blood samples of 20 patients who participated in an ongoing trial and had been on transdermal fentanyl. Fentanyl, norfentanyl, midazolam, and 1'-OH-midazolam were quantified by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma concentrations of fentanyl and norfentanyl exhibited a large variability. Mean estimated total clearance of fentanyl and mean metabolic clearance of midazolam (as a marker of CYP3A activity) were 75.5 and 36.3 L/h. Both clearances showed a weak correlation and hence a minimal influence of CYP3A on fentanyl elimination.",NA,NA,NA

31630606,1,"Bispecific monoclonal antibodies (BsAbs) are engineered proteins with multiple functionalities and properties. The ""bi-specificity"" of these complex biopharmaceuticals is a key characteristic for the development of novel and more effective therapeutic strategies. The high structural complexity of BsAbs poses a challenge to the analytical methods needed for their characterization. Modifications of the BsAb structure, resulting from enzymatic and non-enzymatic processes, further complicate the analysis. An important example of the latter type of modification is glycation, which can occur in the manufacturing process, during storage in the formulation or in vivo after application of the drug. Glycation affects the structure, function, and stability of monoclonal antibodies, and consequently, a detailed analysis of glycation levels is required. Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a key role in the structural characterization of monoclonal antibodies and top-down, middle-up and middle-down MS approaches are increasingly used for the analysis of modifications. Here, we apply a novel middle-up strategy, based on IdeS digestion and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) MS, to analyze all six different BsAb subunits in a single high-resolution mass spectrum, namely two light chains, two half fragment crystallizable regions and two Fd' regions, thus avoiding upfront chromatography. This method was used to monitor glycation changes during a 168 h forced-glycation experiment. In addition, hot spot glycation sites were localized using top-down and middle-down MALDI-in-source decay FT-ICR MS, which provided complementary information compared to standard bottom-up MS.",NA,NA,NA

MIF is a pleiotropic cytokine with chemokine-like functions that has been designated as an atypical chemokine (ACK). It orchestrates leukocyte recruitment and migration into inflamed tissues through non-cognate interactions with the classical chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4, pathways that are further facilitated by MIF's cognate receptor CD74. Here, we describe two complementary methods that can be used to characterize immune cell migration and motility responses controlled by MIF and its receptors. These are the Transwell filter migration assay, also known as modified Boyden chamber assay, a two-dimensional (2D) device, and a matrix-based three-dimensional (3D) chemotaxis assay.

31784594,1,"Early diagnosis of leprosy is challenging, particularly its inflammatory reactions, the major cause of irreversible neuropathy in leprosy. Current diagnostics cannot identify which patients are at risk of developing reactions. This study assessed blood RNA expression levels as potential biomarkers for leprosy. Prospective cohorts of newly diagnosed leprosy patients, including reactions, and healthy controls were recruited in Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia and Nepal. RNA expression in 1,090 whole blood samples was determined for 103 target genes for innate and adaptive immune profiling by dual color Reverse-Transcription Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (dcRT-MLPA) followed by cluster analysis. We identified transcriptomic biomarkers associated with leprosy disease, different leprosy phenotypes as well as high exposure to Mycobacterium leprae which respectively allow improved diagnosis and classification of leprosy patients and detection of infection. Importantly, a transcriptomic signature of risk for reversal reactions consisting of five genes (CCL2, CD8A, IL2, IL15 and MARCO) was identified based on cross-sectional comparison of RNA expression. In addition, intra-individual longitudinal analyses of leprosy patients before, during and after treatment of reversal reactions, indicated that several IFN-induced genes increased significantly at onset of reaction whereas IL15 decreased. This multi-site study, situated in four leprosy endemic areas, demonstrates the potential of host transcriptomic biomarkers as correlates of risk for leprosy. Importantly, a prospective five-gene signature for reversal reactions could predict reversal reactions at least 2 weeks before onset. Thus, transcriptomic biomarkers provide promise for early detection of these acute inflammatory episodes and thereby help prevent permanent neuropathy and disability in leprosy patients.",NA,NA,NA
31785152,1,"Cancer registration plays a key role in monitoring the burden of cancer. However, cancer registry (CR) data are usually made available with substantial delay to ensure best possible completeness of case ascertainment. Here, we investigate empirically with routinely available data whether such a delay is mandatory for survival analyses or whether data can be used earlier to provide more up-to-date survival estimates. We compared distributions of prognostic factors and period relative survival estimates for three population-based CRs in Germany (Schleswig-Holstein (SH), Rhineland-Palatinate (RP), Saarland (SA)) computed on datasets extracted one (DY+1) to 5 years after the year of diagnosis (DY+5; reference). Analyses were conducted for seven cancer sites and various survival analyses scenarios. The proportion of patients registered in the datasets at a given time varied strongly across registries with 57% (SH), 2% (RP) and 26% (SA) registered in DY+1 and >93% in all registries in DY+3. Five-year survival estimates for the most recent three-year period were comparable to estimates from the reference dataset already in DY+1 (mean absolute deviations = 0.2-0.6% units). Deviations >1% units were only observed for pancreatic and lung cancer in RP and leukemia in SA (all ≤1.5% units). For estimates of 1-year survival based on the most recent 1-year period only, slightly longer delays were required, but reasonable estimates were still obtained after 1-2 years, depending on the CR and cancer site.

31811089,1,"Human macrophage migration-inhibitory factor (MIF) is an evolutionarily-conserved protein that has both extracellular immune-modulating and intracellular cell-regulatory functions. MIF plays a role in various diseases, including inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis, autoimmunity, and cancer. It serves as an inflammatory cytokine and chemokine, but also exhibits enzymatic activity. Secreted MIF binds to cell-surface immune receptors such as CD74 and CXCR4. Plants possess MIF orthologs but lack the associated receptors, suggesting functional diversification across kingdoms. Here, we characterized three MIF orthologs (termed MIF/d-dopachrome tautomerase-like proteins or MDLs) of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana Recombinant Arabidopsis MDLs (AtMDLs) share similar secondary structure characteristics with human MIF, yet only have minimal residual tautomerase activity using either p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate or dopachrome methyl ester as substrate. Site-specific mutagenesis suggests that this is due to a distinct amino acid difference at the catalytic cavity-defining residue Asn-98. Surprisingly, AtMDLs bind to the human MIF receptors CD74 and CXCR4. Moreover, they activate CXCR4-dependent signaling in a receptor-specific yeast reporter system and in CXCR4-expressing human HEK293 transfectants. Notably, plant MDLs exert dose-dependent chemotactic activity toward human monocytes and T cells. A small molecule MIF inhibitor and an allosteric CXCR4 inhibitor counteract this function, revealing its specificity. Our results indicate cross-kingdom conservation of the receptor signaling and leukocyte recruitment capacities of human MIF by its plant orthologs. This may point toward a previously unrecognized interplay between plant proteins and the human innate immune system.",NA,NA,NA

We evaluated grey matter volume using voxel-based morphometry, white matter diffusion using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), and region-to-network functional connectivity using dual regression in the default mode network and salience network. We tested for differences between the respective carriers and controls, as well as for divergence of those differences. For the divergence contrast, we additionally performed region-of-interest TBSS analyses in known areas of white matter diffusion differences between FTD and AD (i.e., uncinate fasciculus, forceps minor, and anterior thalamic radiation).",METHODS,NA,NA

31931789,2,We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a stochastic dynamic transmission model that has been calibrated to reported GP visits with influenza-like illness in the Netherlands over 11 seasons (2003/2004 to 2014/2015). We analyzed the costs and effects of extending the current program with vaccination of children aged 2-16 years at 50% coverage over 20 consecutive seasons. We measured the effects in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and we adopted a societal perspective.,METHODS,NA,NA

The childhood vaccination program is not estimated to be cost-effective for the target-group itself with an average ICER of €57,054 per QALY gained. Uncertainty analyses reveal that these ICERs hide a wide range of outcomes. Even though introduction of a childhood vaccination program decreases the number of infections, it tends to lead to larger epidemics: in 23.3% of 1000 simulations, the childhood vaccination program results in an increase in seasons with a symptomatic attack rate larger than 5%, which is expected to cause serious strain on the health care system. In 6.4% of 1000 simulations, the childhood vaccination program leads to a net loss of QALYs. These findings are robust across different targeted age groups and vaccination coverages.",RESULTS,NA,NA

31963324,1,"Indonesia has limited data on asbestos-related diseases despite abundant use. This study investigated the risk of occupational asbestos exposure for lung cancer development, utilizing a hospital-based case-control study. Subjects were patients who received a thoracic CT scan at Persahabatan Hospital, Jakarta. The cases had primary lung cancer confirmed by histology, the controls were negative for lung cancer. The cumulative occupational asbestos exposure was calculated by multiplying the exposure intensity by the years of exposure. The exposure intensity was obtained by adopting the weighted arithmetic mean value of asbestos exposure from a job-exposure matrix developed in Korea. The primary data analysis was based on logistic regression. The study included 696 subjects, with 336 cases and 360 controls. The chance of lung cancer for subjects exposed to asbestos was doubled (OR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.21-3.42) compared with unexposed, and subjects with a cumulative asbestos exposure of 10 fiber-years or more even showed an OR of 3.08 (95% CI = 1.01-9.46). The OR of the combined effect between smoking and asbestos was 8.7 (95% CI = 1.71-44.39); the interaction was consistent with an additive and multiplicative risk model. Asbestos exposure is associated with a higher chance of lung cancer. Improved policies are needed to protect the population from asbestos hazards.",NA,NA,NA

This study examines the impacts of 2015 regulatory changes in Danish dental care which aimed at effectuating a transition from six-to-twelve-monthly dental recall intervals, for every patient, towards a model where patients with higher need receive dental recalls systematically more frequently than patients with lower need. Exploiting administrative data from the years 2012-2016 from the Danish National Health Insurance database containing 72,155,539 treatment claims for 3,759,721 unique patients, we estimated a series of interrupted time-series regression models with patient-level fixed-effects. In comparison to the pre-reform period, the proportion of patients with recall intervals of up to 6 months was by 1.2%-points larger post-implementation; that of patients with 6-12-monthly recalls increased by 0.7%-points; that of patients with more than 12-monthly dental recalls decreased by 1.9%-points. The composition of care shifted more substantially: the proportion of treatment sessions including preventive care increased by 31.5%-points (95%-CI: 31.4;31.6); that of sessions including scaling increased by 24.1%-points (24.0;24.2); that of sessions including diagnostics decreased by 34.5%-points (34.4;34.6).

31986930,1,"Background: Non-contact induction heating (NCIH) is a noninvasive treatment modality that can be used to cause thermal damage to bacterial biofilms on a metal implant surface in the context of a prosthetic joint infection. The purpose of this study was (1) to determine the effectiveness of NCIH on killing Staphylococcus aureus from biofilm and (2) to determine the possible synergistic effect of NCIH and cocktails of antibiotics and N-acetylcysteine (NAC).Methods: Staphylococcus aureus biofilms were grown on titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) coupons. These coupons were heated to 50 °C, 60 °C, 70 °C, 80 °C, and 90 °C for 3.5 min and subsequently exposed to cocktails of vancomycin, rifampicin and NAC at clinically relevant concentrations over 24 h.Results: In the control group without induction heating, 2.2*107 colony forming units (CFU)/cm2 were observed. At 50 °C, 60 °C, 70 °C, 80 °C, and 90 °C, a reduction of 0.3-log, 3.9-log, 4.2-log, 4.3-log, and 6.6-log CFU/cm2 were observed, respectively. There was synergy between antibiotics and induction heating that resulted in less than 100 CFU/cm2 remaining after 3.5 min at 60 °C, and exposure to vancomycin and rifampicin. Total eradication was observed at 80 °C. Total eradication was also observed at 60 °C and a cocktail of antibiotics with NAC.Conclusion: Induction heating of titanium alloy coupons is effective for the reduction of bacterial load in vitro in S. aureus biofilms. Induction heating and cocktails of antibiotics and NAC have a synergistic effect that results in the total eradication of the biofilm at 60 °C and higher for clinically relevant concentrations of vancomycin, rifampicin and NAC.",NA,NA,NA
31998285,1,"Background: Neonatal antibiotics disturb the developing gut microbiome and are therefore thought to influence the developing immune system, but exact mechanisms and health consequences in later life still need to be elucidated. Therefore, we investigated whether neonatal antibiotics influence inflammatory markers at 1 year of age. In addition, we determined whether health problems during the first year of life, e.g., allergic disorders (eczema and wheezing) or infantile colics, were associated with changes in the circulating immune marker profile at 1 year of age. Methods: In a subgroup (N = 149) of the INCA-study, a prospective birth-cohort study, a blood sample was drawn from term born infants at 1 year of age and analyzed for 84 immune related markers using Luminex. Associations of antibiotic treatment, eczema, wheezing, and infantile colics with immune marker concentrations were investigated using a linear regression model. The trial is registered as NCT02536560. Results: The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in the first week of life, was significantly associated with different levels of inflammatory markers including sVCAM-1, sCD14, sCD19, sCD27, IL-1RII, sVEGF-R1, and HSP70 at 1 year of age. Eczema was associated with decreased concentrations of IFNα, IFNγ, TSLP, CXCL9, and CXCL13, but increased concentrations of CCL18 and Galectin-3. Wheezing, independent of antibiotic treatment, was positively associated to TNF-R2 and resistin. Infantile colics were positively associated to IL-31, LIGHT, YKL-40, CXCL13, sPD1, IL1RI, sIL-7Ra, Gal-1, Gal-9, and S100A8 at 1 year of age, independent of early life antibiotic treatment. Conclusion: In this explorative study, we identified that neonatal antibiotics are associated with immunological alterations at 1 year of age and that, independent of the antibiotic treatment, infantile colics were associated with alterations within gut associated markers. These findings support the importance of the first host microbe interaction in early life immune development.",NA,ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT02536560

Even less is known about mental long-term impacts of TTC. This study aims at a better understanding of the physical and mental long-term effects of TTC in comparison to myocardial infarctions (MI). On average 5 years after disease onset, 68 TTC patients and 68 age- and sex-matched MI patients were assessed for disease-related quality of life, depression, anxiety, chronic stress, social support, resilience, and life events prior to disease onset. Scores of TTC and MI patients were compared to each other and to normative references values. Regression analyses were used to evaluate the predictive value of the number of life events prior to disease onset for physical and mental long-term outcomes. Both groups displayed higher scores in depression and anxiety, higher levels of chronic stress, and lower scores in physical and mental quality of life in comparison to norm samples, while social support did not differ from norms. No differences between the two patient groups were observed. Within both groups, the majority of patients (TTC: 69.1%; MI: 60.3%) reported stressful life events prior to disease onset. In TTCs and MIs, the number of events had a significant impact on long-term mental health and chronic stress. Notably, both patient collectives scored higher in resilience than healthy controls. Results suggest negative long-term impacts of TTC on mental and physical wellbeing, comparable to those of MI. Besides a good somatic-medical care, psychotherapeutic support, including the development of functional coping strategies, might be warranted for TTC patients. The long-term impact of TTC should be taken as serious as that of MI.",NA,NA,NA

32189037,1,"Damage to cellular macromolecules and organelles by chemical exposure evokes activation of various stress response pathways. To what extent different chemical stressors activate common and stressor-specific pathways is largely unknown. Here, we used quantitative phosphoproteomics to compare the signaling events induced by four stressors with different modes of action: the DNA damaging agent: cisplatin (CDDP), the topoisomerase II inhibitor: etoposide (ETO), the pro-oxidant: diethyl maleate (DEM) and the immunosuppressant: cyclosporine A (CsA) administered at an equitoxic dose to mouse embryonic stem cells. We observed major differences between the stressors in the number and identity of responsive phosphosites and the amplitude of phosphorylation. Kinase motif and pathway analyses indicated that the DNA damage response (DDR) activation by CDDP occurs predominantly through the replication-stress-related Atr kinase, whereas ETO triggers the DDR through Atr as well as the DNA double-strand-break-associated Atm kinase. CsA shares with ETO activation of CK2 kinase. Congruent with their known modes of action, CsA-mediated signaling is related to down-regulation of pathways that control hematopoietic differentiation and immunity, whereas oxidative stress is the most prominent initiator of DEM-modulated stress signaling. This study shows that even at equitoxic doses, different stressors induce distinctive and complex phosphorylation signaling cascades.",NA,NA,NA
32231344,1,"In order to evaluate the technical adaptability of a type of disposable endoscope compared to reusable flexible endoscopes, in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted. A disposable digital ureteroscope (""chip on tip"") and two reusable endoscopes were investigated with respect to spatial resolution, geometric distortion in air and water the maximum. Additionally, the clinical performance of the disposable device was tested during clinical procedures (n = 20). The disposable endoscope showed an optical resolution of 6.72 lines/mm at 10 mm distance, similar to the other devices. In comparison, the disposable endoscope showed a barrel-shaped image distortion in air of -24.2%, which is in the middle range, but was best under water (-8.6%). The bendability of 297° (275 µm fiber) and 316° (empty channel, 1.5 F basket) and the maximum irrigation (1 m: 58.1 ml/min, 2 m: 91.9 ml/min) were convincing.

In absence of myocardium, this outgrowth was not directional. Neurite differentiation of PC12 cells in conditioned medium confirmed these results via a paracrine effect, in accordance with expression of neurotrophic factors in myocardial explants co-cultured with EPDCs. Of interest, EPDCs increased the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) in cultured, but not in fresh myocardium, possibly due to an ""ischemic state"" of cultured myocardium, supported by TUNEL and Hif1α expression.

Human milk and infant milk formulas (IMF) seem to impact maturation of these gut functions differently, which is at least partially related to high temperature processing of IMF causing loss of bioactive proteins and formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Both loss of protein bioactivity and formation of AGEs depend on heating temperature and time.

32369774,1,"Glucocorticoids mediate numerous essential processes in the human body via binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Excessive GR signaling can cause disease, and GR antagonists can be used to treat many symptoms of glucocorticoid-induced pathology. The purpose of this study was to characterize the tissue-specific properties of the selective GR antagonist CORT125281. We evaluated the antagonistic effects of CORT125281 upon acute and subchronic corticosterone exposure in mice. In the acute corticosterone setting, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal-axis activity was investigated by measurement of basal- and stress-induced corticosterone levels, adrenocorticotropic hormone levels and pituitary proopiomelanocortin expression. GR signaling was evaluated by RT-PCR analysis of GR-responsive transcripts in liver, muscle, brown adipose tissue (BAT), white adipose tissue (WAT) and hippocampus. Pretreatment with a high dose of CORT125281 antagonized GR activity in a tissue-dependent manner. We observed complete inhibition of GR-induced target gene expression in the liver, partial blockade in muscle and BAT and no antagonism in WAT and hippocampus. Tissue distribution only partially explained the lack of effective antagonism. CORT125281 treatment did not disinhibit the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal neuroendocrine axis. In the subchronic corticosterone setting, CORT125281 partially prevented corticosterone-induced hyperinsulinemia, but not hyperlipidemia and immune suppression. In conclusion, CORT125281 antagonizes GR transcriptional activity in a tissue-dependent manner and improves corticosterone-induced hyperinsulinemia. Tailored dosing of CORT125281 may allow tissue-specific inhibition of GR transcriptional activity.",NA,NA,NA

32429039,1,"The naturally occurring isothiocyanate sulforaphane, found in Brassicaceae vegetables, is promising in cancer treatment, e.g., by the normalization of enhanced levels of NF-κB-signaling in tumor stem cells. We chemically synthesized seven sulforaphane analogues by substitution of the sulfinyl group (S(O)) to either sulfimidoyl (S(NR)) or sulfonimidoyl (S (O) (NR)) groups, and characterized them in the cell lines of pancreatic cancer and several other tumor entities, including the NCI-60 cell panel. MTT and colony forming assays, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, microRNA arrays, bioinformatics, tumor xenotransplantation, and Kaplan Meier survival curves were performed. Compared to sulforaphane, the analogue SF102 was most efficient in inhibition of viability, colony formation, tumor growth, and the induction of apoptosis, followed by SF134. Side effects were not observed, as concluded from the body weight and liver histology of chick embryos and survival of C. elegans nematodes. Among 6659 differentially regulated microRNAs, miR29b-1-5p, and miR-27b-5p were downregulated by sulforaphane compared to controls, but upregulated by SF102 and SF134 compared to sulforaphane, suggesting differential signaling.

Because the worst-case scenario of strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors has to be tested, the results and their validity have to be balanced with the risk to volunteer safety. The use of ketoconazole in clinical DDI studies has been discouraged by regulatory agencies due to an alleged risk of liver injury. In order to reduce the risk to healthy volunteers, we carried out a study with single-day exposure to each of 6 perpetrator azole fungistatic drugs. They were evaluated regarding their CYP3A inhibition using microdosed midazolam and a limited sampling strategy. Ratios of areas under the concentration-time curves ranged from 1.93 with isavuconazole to 8.42 with ketoconazole. The highest number of adverse events occurred with voriconazole, followed by ketoconazole; 2 dropouts occurred due to adverse events following itraconazole administration. Literature data on adverse events of azole fungistatic drugs in DDI trials are rare and inconclusive. Only in recent years with the newer drugs are they more precise and reliable. It can be concluded that the duration of preexposure of perpetrator drugs can be reduced to 1 hour before administration of the victim drug.

32554321,1,"Anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI and resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) have been used for Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification. These scans are typically used to build models for discriminating AD patients from control subjects, but it is not clear if these models can also discriminate AD in diverse clinical populations as found in memory clinics. To study this, we trained MRI-based AD classification models on a single centre data set consisting of AD patients (N = 76) and controls (N = 173), and used these models to assign AD scores to subjective memory complainers (N = 67), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients (N = 61), and AD patients (N = 61) from a multi-centre memory clinic data set. The anatomical MRI scans were used to calculate grey matter density, subcortical volumes and cortical thickness, the diffusion MRI scans were used to calculate fractional anisotropy, mean, axial and radial diffusivity, and the rs-fMRI scans were used to calculate functional connectivity between resting state networks and amplitude of low frequency fluctuations. Within the multi-centre memory clinic data set we removed scan site differences prior to applying the models. For all models, on average, the AD patients were assigned the highest AD scores, followed by MCI patients, and later followed by SMC subjects. The anatomical MRI models performed best, and the best performing anatomical MRI measure was grey matter density, separating SMC subjects from MCI patients with an AUC of 0.69, MCI patients from AD patients with an AUC of 0.70, and SMC patients from AD patients with an AUC of 0.86. The diffusion MRI models did not generalise well to the memory clinic data, possibly because of large scan site differences. The functional connectivity model separated SMC subjects and MCI patients relatively good (AUC = 0.66). The multimodal MRI model did not improve upon the anatomical MRI model. In conclusion, we showed that the grey matter density model generalises best to memory clinic subjects. When also considering the fact that grey matter density generally performs well in AD classification studies, this feature is probably the best MRI-based feature for AD diagnosis in clinical practice.",NA,NA,NA

32599726,1,"Background: Local spirometric prediction equations are of great importance for interpreting lung function results and deciding on the management strategies for respiratory patients, yet available data from African countries are scarce. The aim of this study was to collect lung function data using spirometry in healthy adults living in Maputo, Mozambique and to derive first spirometric prediction equations for this population. Methods: We applied a cross-sectional study design. Participants, who met the inclusion criteria, underwent a short interview, anthropometric measurements, and lung function testing. Different modelling approaches were followed for generating new, Mozambican, prediction equations and for comparison with the Global Lung Initiative (GLI) and South African equations. The pulmonary function performance of participants was assessed against the different reference standards. Results: A total of 212 males and females were recruited, from whom 155 usable spirometry results were obtained. The mean age of participants was 35.20 years (SD 10.99) and 93 of 155 (59.35%) were females. The predicted values for forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and the FEV1/FVC ratio based on the Mozambican equations were lower than the South African-and the GLI-based predictions. Conclusions: This study provides first data on pulmonary function in healthy Mozambican adults and describes how they compare to GLI and South African reference values for spirometry.",NA,NA,NA
32612587,1,"Mycobacterium leprae, the causative agent of leprosy, is an unculturable bacterium with a considerably reduced genome (3.27 Mb) compared to homologues mycobacteria from the same ancestry. In 2001, the genome of M. leprae was first described and subsequently four genotypes (1-4) and 16 subtypes (A-P) were identified providing means to study global transmission patterns for leprosy. In order to understand the role of asymptomatic carriers we investigated M. leprae carriage as well as infection in leprosy patients (n = 60) and healthy household contacts (HHC; n = 250) from Bangladesh using molecular detection of the bacterial element RLEP in nasal swabs (NS) and slit skin smears (SSS). In parallel, to study M. leprae genotype distribution in Bangladesh we explored strain diversity by whole genome sequencing (WGS) and Sanger sequencing. In the studied cohort in Bangladesh, M. leprae DNA was detected in 33.3% of NS and 22.2% of SSS of patients with bacillary index of 0 whilst in HHC 18.0% of NS and 12.3% of SSS were positive. The majority of the M. leprae strains detected in this study belonged to genotype 1D (55%), followed by 1A (31%). Importantly, WGS allowed the identification of a new M. leprae genotype, designated 1B-Bangladesh (14%), which clustered separately between the 1A and 1B strains. Moreover, we established that the genotype previously designated 1C, is not an independent subtype but clusters within the 1D genotype. Intraindividual differences were present between the M. leprae strains obtained including mutations in hypermutated genes, suggesting mixed colonization/infection or in-host evolution. In summary, we observed that M. leprae is present in asymptomatic contacts of leprosy patients fueling the concept that these individuals contribute to the current intensity of transmission. Our data therefore emphasize the importance of sensitive and specific tools allowing post-exposure prophylaxis targeted at M. leprae-infected or -colonized individuals.",NA,NA,NA

32772302,1,"CYP3A plays an important role in drug metabolism and, thus, can be a considerable liability for drug-drug interactions. Population pharmacokinetics may be an efficient tool for detecting such drug-drug interactions. Multiple models have been developed for midazolam, the typical probe substrate for CYP3A activity, but no population pharmacokinetic models have been developed for use with inhibition or induction. The objective of the current analysis was to develop a composite parent-metabolite model for midazolam which could adequately describe CYP3A drug-drug interactions. As an exploratory objective, parameters were assessed for potential cut-points which may allow for determination of drug-drug interactions when a baseline profile is not available. The final interaction model adequately described midazolam and 1'-OH midazolam concentrations for constitutive, inhibited, and induced CYP3A activity. The model showed good internal and external validity, both with full profiles and limited sampling (2, 2.5, 3, and 4 h), and the model predicted parameters were congruent with values found in clinical studies. Assessment of potential cut-points for model predicted parameters to assess drug-drug interaction liability with a single profile suggested that midazolam clearance may reasonably be used to detect inhibition (4.82-16.4 L/h), induction (41.8-88.9 L/h), and no modulation (16.4-41.8 L/h), with sensitivities for potent inhibition and induction of 87.9% and 83.3%, respectively, and a specificity of 98.2% for no modulation. Thus, the current model and cut-points could provide efficient and accurate tools for drug-drug liability detection, both during drug development and in the clinic, following prospective validation in healthy volunteers and patient populations.",NA,NA,NA
32790063,1,"Microglia activation is the brain's major immune response to amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of soluble TREM2 (sTREM2), a biomarker of microglia activation, and microglia PET are increased in AD; however, whether an increase in these biomarkers is associated with reduced amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation remains unclear. To address this question, we pursued a two-pronged translational approach. Firstly, in non-demented and demented individuals, we tested CSF sTREM2 at baseline to predict (i) amyloid PET changes over ∼2 years and (ii) tau PET cross-sectionally assessed in a subset of patients. We found higher CSF sTREM2 associated with attenuated amyloid PET increase and lower tau PET. Secondly, in the AppNL-G-F mouse model of amyloidosis, we studied baseline 18 F-GE180 microglia PET and longitudinal amyloid PET to test the microglia vs. Aβ association, without any confounding co-pathologies often present in AD patients. Higher microglia PET at age 5 months was associated with a slower amyloid PET increase between ages 5-to-10 months. In conclusion, higher microglia activation as determined by CSF sTREM2 or microglia PET shows protective effects on subsequent amyloid accumulation.",NA,NA,NA
32801116,1,"Patients with a congenital bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), a valve with two instead of three aortic leaflets, have an increased risk of developing thoracic aneurysms and aortic dissection. The mechanisms underlying BAV-associated aortopathy are poorly understood. This study examined BAV-associated aortopathy in Nos3-/- mice, a model with congenital BAV formation. A combination of histological examination and in vivo ultrasound imaging was used to investigate aortic dilation and dissections in Nos3-/- mice. Moreover, cell lineage analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing were used to observe the molecular anomalies within vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of Nos3-/- mice. Spontaneous aortic dissections were found in ascending aortas located at the sinotubular junction in ∼13% of Nos3-/- mice. Moreover, Nos3-/- mice were prone to developing aortic dilations in the proximal and distal ascending aorta during early adulthood. Lower volumes of elastic fibres were found within vessel walls of the ascending aortas of Nos3-/- mice, as well as incomplete coverage of the aortic inner media by neural crest cell (NCC)-derived VSMCs. VSMCs of Nos3-/- mice showed downregulation of 15 genes, of which seven were associated with aortic aneurysms and dissections in the human population. Elastin mRNA was most markedly downregulated, followed by fibulin-5 expression, both primary components of elastic fibres. This study demonstrates that, in addition to congenital BAV formation, disrupted endothelial-mediated nitric oxide (NO) signalling in Nos3-/- mice also causes aortic dilation and dissection, as a consequence of inhibited elastic fibre formation in VSMCs within the ascending aorta.",NA,NA,NA

32858150,1,"The Single Prolonged Stress protocol is considered a model for PTSD, as it induces long lasting changes in rat behaviour and endocrine regulation. Previous work demonstrated that some of these changes can be prevented by treatment with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486, administered a week after the stressor. The current study evaluated the effects of an earlier intervention with RU486, as evaluated 1 week after SPS-exposure. Most RU486 effects occurred independent of prior stress, except for the reversal of a stress-induced increase in locomotor behaviour. The accompanying changes in gene expression depended on gene, brain region, and time. DNA methylation of the robustly down-regulated Fkbp5 gene was dissociated of changes in mRNA expression. The findings reinforce the long term effects of GR antagonist treatment, but also emphasize the need to evaluate changes over time to allow the identification of robust correlates between gene expression and behavioural/endocrine outcome of stressful experiences.",NA,NA,NA

Microdosed midazolam is increasingly used for this purpose; a buccal formulation might be of advantage, but buccal absorption might occur. We therefore tested in a single-center, open-label clinical trial with 12 healthy volunteers the absolute bioavailability of 10 μg of midazolam after buccal administration in relation to buccal exposure time. In relation to a drinking solution, there was an increase of midazolam exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity) with increasing buccal exposure time with an apparent saturation at 100-second buccal exposure. Absolute bioavailability increased from 27.8% (95% confidence interval, 23.5-32.9) for the drinking solution (0 seconds) to 66.1% (95% confidence interval, 60.0-72.8) after 100-second buccal exposure with no further increase after 150 seconds. A Hill equation described the time dependency of midazolam bioavailability with maximal bioavailability as 64.5% and buccal exposure time resulting in half maximal bioavailability increase as 16 seconds. In conclusion, midazolam bioavailability is highly dependent on buccal exposure time, and even a few seconds of buccal exposure will increase bioavailability due to buccal absorption.

We included 56,068 women of European ancestry diagnosed with first invasive breast cancer from 1990 onward with follow-up from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. Metachronous CBC risk (N = 1,027) according to the distribution of PRS313 was quantified using Cox regression analyses. We assessed PRS313 interaction with age at first diagnosis, family history, morphology, ER status, PR status, and HER2 status, and (neo)adjuvant therapy. In studies of Asian women, with limited follow-up, CBC risk associated with PRS313 was assessed using logistic regression for 340 women with CBC compared with 12,133 women with unilateral breast cancer. Higher PRS313 was associated with increased CBC risk: hazard ratio per standard deviation (SD) = 1.25 (95%CI = 1.18-1.33) for Europeans, and an OR per SD = 1.15 (95%CI = 1.02-1.29) for Asians. The absolute lifetime risks of CBC, accounting for death as competing risk, were 12.4% for European women at the 10th percentile and 20.5% at the 90th percentile of PRS313. We found no evidence of confounding by or interaction with individual characteristics, characteristics of the primary tumor, or treatment. The C-index for the PRS313 alone was 0.563 (95%CI = 0.547-0.586). In conclusion, PRS313 is an independent factor associated with CBC risk and can be incorporated into CBC risk prediction models to help improve stratification and optimize surveillance and treatment strategies.",NA,NA,NA

33076454,1,"Protein N-glycosylation is a multifactorial process involved in many biological processes. A broad range of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) have been described that feature defects in protein N-glycan biosynthesis. Here, we present insights into the disrupted N-glycosylation of various CDG patients exhibiting defects in the transport of nucleotide sugars, Golgi glycosylation or Golgi trafficking. We studied enzymatically released N-glycans of total plasma proteins and affinity purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) from patients and healthy controls using mass spectrometry (MS). The applied method allowed the differentiation of sialic acid linkage isomers via their derivatization. Furthermore, protein-specific glycan profiles were quantified for transferrin and IgG Fc using electrospray ionization MS of intact proteins and glycopeptides, respectively. Next to the previously described glycomic effects, we report unprecedented sialic linkage-specific effects. Defects in proteins involved in Golgi trafficking (COG5-CDG) and CMP-sialic acid transport (SLC35A1-CDG) resulted in lower levels of sialylated structures on plasma proteins as compared to healthy controls. Findings for these specific CDGs include a more pronounced effect for α2,3-sialylation than for α2,6-sialylation.

33158188,1,"Human milk is the optimal diet for infant development, but infant milk formula (IMF) must be available as an alternative. To develop high-quality IMF, bovine milk processing is required to ensure microbial safety and to obtain a protein composition that mimics human milk. However, processing can impact the quality of milk proteins, which can influence gastro-intestinal (GI) tolerance by changing digestion, transit time and/or absorption. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of structural changes of proteins due to thermal processing on gastro-intestinal tolerance in the immature GI tract. Preterm and near-term piglets received enteral nutrition based on whey protein concentrate (WPC) either mildly pasteurized (MP-WPC) or extensively heated (EH-WPC). Clinical symptoms, transit time and gastric residuals were evaluated. In addition, protein coagulation and protein composition of coagulates formed during in vitro digestion were analyzed in more detail. Characterization of MP-WPC and EH-WPC revealed that mild pasteurization maintained protein nativity and reduced aggregation of β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin, relative to EH-WPC. Mild pasteurization reduced the formation of coagulates during digestion, resulting in reduced gastric residual volume and increased intestinal tract content. In addition, preterm piglets receiving MP-WPC showed reduced mucosal bacterial adherence in the proximal small intestine. Finally, in vitro digestion studies revealed less protein coagulation and lower levels of β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin in the coagulates of MP-WPC compared with EH-WPC. In conclusion, minimal heat treatment of WPC compared with extensive heating promoted GI tolerance in immature piglets, implying that minimal heated WPC could improve the GI tolerance of milk formulas in infants.",NA,NA,NA

33239628,1,"Targeting a specific chemokine/receptor axis in atherosclerosis remains challenging. Soluble receptor-based strategies are not established for chemokine receptors due to their discontinuous architecture. Macrophage migration-inhibitory factor (MIF) is an atypical chemokine that promotes atherosclerosis through CXC-motif chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4). However, CXCR4/CXCL12 interactions also mediate atheroprotection. Here, we show that constrained 31-residue-peptides ('msR4Ms') designed to mimic the CXCR4-binding site to MIF, selectively bind MIF with nanomolar affinity and block MIF/CXCR4 without affecting CXCL12/CXCR4. We identify msR4M-L1, which blocks MIF- but not CXCL12-elicited CXCR4 vascular cell activities. Its potency compares well with established MIF inhibitors, whereas msR4M-L1 does not interfere with cardioprotective MIF/CD74 signaling. In vivo-administered msR4M-L1 enriches in atherosclerotic plaques, blocks arterial leukocyte adhesion, and inhibits atherosclerosis and inflammation in hyperlipidemic Apoe-/- mice in vivo. Finally, msR4M-L1 binds to MIF in plaques from human carotid-endarterectomy specimens.

This process, called central vestibular compensation (VC), involves a wide range of functional and structural mechanisms at the cellular and network level. The short-term dynamics of whole-brain functional network recruitment and recalibration during VC has not been depicted in vivo. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interplay of separate and distinct brain regions and in vivo networks in the course of VC by sequential [18F]-FDG-PET-based statistical and graph theoretical analysis with the aim of revealing the metabolic connectome before and 1, 3, 7, and 15 days post unilateral labyrinthectomy (UL) in the rat. Temporal changes in metabolic brain connectivity were determined by Pearson's correlation (|r| > 0.5, p < 0.001) of regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCGM) in 57 segmented brain regions. Metabolic connectivity analysis was compared to univariate voxel-wise statistical analysis of rCGM over time and to behavioral scores of static and dynamic sensorimotor recovery. Univariate statistical analysis revealed an ipsilesional relative rCGM decrease (compared to baseline) and a contralesional rCGM increase in vestibular and limbic networks and an increase in bilateral cerebellar and sensorimotor networks. Quantitative analysis of the metabolic connections showed a maximal increase from baseline to day 3 post UL (interhemispheric: 2-fold, ipsilesional: 3-fold, contralesional: 12-fold) and a gradual decline until day 15 post UL, which paralleled the dynamics of vestibular symptoms. In graph theoretical analysis, an increase in connectivity occurred especially within brain regions associated with brainstem-cerebellar and thalamocortical vestibular networks and cortical sensorimotor networks. At the symptom peak (day 3 post UL), brain networks were found to be organized in large ensembles of distinct and highly connected hubs of brain regions, which separated again with progressing VC. Thus, we found rapid changes in network organization at the subcortical and cortical level and in both hemispheres, which may indicate an initial functional substitution of vestibular loss and subsequent recalibration and reorganization of sensorimotor networks during VC.",NA,NA,NA
33291582,1,"(1) Background: To estimate the cumulative exposure to respirable crystalline silica (RCS) that reduces lung function to an extent corresponding with airway obstruction equivalent to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). (2) Methods: The study is based on a miners' cohort with longitudinal data on lung function and RCS exposure. Random-effects linear regression models, allowing for a possible threshold concerning the exposure concentration were used to analyze the impact of RCS on the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 s and forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC). The proposed threshold is the amount of RCS resulting in a decrease in FEV1/FVC from the expected value to the lower limit of normal. (3) Results: The analysis shows that a threshold model fits the data significantly better than the usual linear model. The estimated threshold value for the exposure concentration is 0.089 mg/m3. Using this threshold, the estimate for the corresponding reference dose for RCS is 2.33 mg/m3·y. (4) Conclusions: The analysis confirmed that RCS has a negative impact on lung function. The effect is primarily due to exposure above a concentration threshold of 0.1 mg/m3. It is recommended that COPD should be compensated as an occupational disease if cumulative exposure was at least 2 mg/m3·y above this threshold.",NA,NA,NA

33565160,1,"The chemokine-like inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pivotal driver of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, cardiovascular disease, autoimmunity, and cancer. MIF modulates the early inflammatory response through various mechanisms, including regulation of neutrophil recruitment and fate, but the mechanisms and the role of the more recently described MIF homolog MIF-2 (D-dopachrome tautomerase; D-DT) are incompletely understood. Here, we show that both MIF and MIF-2/D-DT inhibit neutrophil apoptosis. This is not a direct effect, but involves the activation of mononuclear cells, which secrete CXCL8 and other prosurvival mediators to promote neutrophil survival. Individually, CXCL8 and MIF (or MIF-2) did not significantly inhibit neutrophil apoptosis, but in combination they elicited a synergistic response, promoting neutrophil survival even in the absence of mononuclear cells. The use of receptor-specific inhibitors provided evidence for a causal role of the noncognate MIF receptor CXCR2 expressed on both monocytes and neutrophils in MIF-mediated neutrophil survival. We suggest that the ability to inhibit neutrophil apoptosis contributes to the proinflammatory role ascribed to MIF, and propose that blocking the interaction between MIF and CXCR2 could be an important anti-inflammatory strategy in the early inflammatory response.",NA,NA,NA
33602971,1,"Individuals with chronic kidney disease are at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. This risk may partially be explained by a chronic inflammatory state in these patients, reflected by increased arterial wall and cellular inflammation. Statin treatment decreases cardiovascular risk and arterial inflammation in non-CKD subjects. In patients with declining kidney function, cardiovascular benefit resulting from statin therapy is attenuated, possibly due to persisting inflammation. In the current study, we assessed the effect of statin treatment on arterial wall and cellular inflammation. Fourteen patients with chronic kidney disease stage 3 or 4, defined by an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate between 15 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, without cardiovascular disease were included in a single center, open label study to assess the effect of atorvastatin 40 mg once daily for 12 weeks (NTR6896). At baseline and at 12 weeks of treatment, we assessed arterial wall inflammation by 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron-emission tomography computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) and the phenotype of circulating monocytes were assessed. Treatment with atorvastatin resulted in a 46% reduction in LDL-cholesterol, but this was not accompanied by an attenuation in arterial wall inflammation in the aorta or carotid arteries, nor with changes in chemokine receptor expression of circulating monocytes. Statin treatment does not abolish arterial wall or cellular inflammation in subjects with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease. These results imply that CKD-associated inflammatory activity is mediated by factors beyond LDL-cholesterol and specific anti-inflammatory interventions might be necessary to further dampen the inflammatory driven CV risk in these subjects.",NA,NTR,NTR6896

Associations between habitual dietary intake, assessed via repeated 24-h food lists and a Food Frequency Questionnaire, and the 20 subgroups, as well as between prevalence of metabolic diseases/risk factors and the subgroups, were assessed with multivariate-adjusted Dirichlet regression models. After adjustment for multiple testing, eight of 20 microbial subgroups were significantly associated with habitual diet, while nine of 20 microbial subgroups were associated with the prevalence of one or more metabolic diseases/risk factors. Subgroups 5 (Faecalibacterium, Lachnospiracea incertae sedis, Gemmiger, Roseburia) and 14 (Coprococcus, Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus) were particularly strongly associated with diet.

33763438,1,"Background: Over the past decades, the preterm birth rate has increased, mostly due to a rise in late and moderate preterm (LMPT, 32-36 weeks gestation) births. LMPT birth affects 6-7% of all births in the United Kingdom and is associated with increased morbidity risk after birth in infancy as well as in adulthood. Early life nutrition has a critical role in determining infant growth and development, but there are limited data specifically addressing LMPT infants, which was the rationale for the design of the current study. Objective: The Feeding Late and Moderate Infants and Growth Outcomes (FLAMINGO) study aims to improve understanding of the longitudinal growth, nutritional needs, and body composition of LMPT infants as well as their microbiome development and neurodevelopment. In addition, having a nested non-inferiority trial enables evaluation of the nutritional adequacy of a concept IMF with large milk phospholipid-coated lipid droplets comprising dairy and vegetable lipids. The primary outcome of this RCT is daily weight gain until 3 months corrected age. Methods: A total of 250 healthy LMPT infants (32+0-36+6 weeks gestational age) with birth weight 1.25-3.0 kg will be recruited to the cohort, of which 140 infants are anticipated to be enrolled in the RCT. During six visits over the first 2 years of life, anthropometry, body composition (using dual energy X-Ray absorptiometry), feeding behavior, and developmental outcomes will be measured. Saliva and stool samples will be collected for oral and gut microbiota assessment. Discussion: The FLAMINGO study will improve understanding of the longitudinal growth, body composition development, and feeding characteristics of LMPT infants and gain insights into their microbiome and neurodevelopment.

However, a substantial variability in CBF across the clinical spectrum of AD has been reported, possibly due to differences in primary AD pathologies. Here, we assessed CBF (ASL-MRI), tau (AV1451-PET) and amyloid (AV45/FBB-PET) in 156 subjects across the AD continuum. Using mixed-effect regression analyses, we assessed the local associations between amyloid-PET, tau-PET and CBF in a hypothesis-driven way focusing on each pathology's predilection areas. The contribution of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, and MRI markers of small vessel disease (SVD) to alterations in CBF were assessed as well. Tau-PET was associated with lower CBF in the entorhinal cortex, independent of Aβ. Amyloid-PET was associated with lower CBF in temporo-parietal regions. No associations between MRI markers of SVD and CBF were observed. These results provide evidence that in addition to Aβ, pathologic tau is a major correlate of CBF in early Braak stages, independent of Aβ, APOE genotype and SVD markers.",NA,NA,NA
33831550,1,"Metabolic connectivity patterns on the basis of [18F]-FDG positron emission tomography (PET) are used to depict complex cerebral network alterations in different neurological disorders and therefore may have the potential to support diagnostic decisions. In this study, we established a novel statistical classification method taking advantage of differential time-dependent states of whole-brain metabolic connectivity following unilateral labyrinthectomy (UL) in the rat and explored its classification accuracy. The dataset consisted of repeated [18F]-FDG PET measurements at baseline and 1, 3, 7, and 15 days (= maximum of 5 classes) after UL with 17 rats per measurement day. Classification in different stages after UL was performed by determining connectivity patterns for the different classes by Pearson's correlation between uptake values in atlas-based segmented brain regions. Connections were fitted with a linear function, with which different thresholds on the correlation coefficient (r = [0.5, 0.85]) were investigated. Rats were classified by determining the congruence of their PET uptake pattern with the fitted connectivity patterns in the classes. Overall, the classification accuracy with this method was 84.3% for 3 classes, 75.0% for 4 classes, and 54.1% for 5 classes and outperformed random classification as well as machine learning classification on the same dataset. The optimal classification thresholds of the correlation coefficient and distance-to-fit were found to be |r| > 0.65 and d = 4 when using Siegel's slope estimator for fitting. This connectivity-based classification method can compete with machine learning classification and may have methodological advantages when applied to support PET-based diagnostic decisions in neurological network disorders (such as neurodegenerative syndromes).",NA,NA,NA
33841801,1,"Quantitative measurements and qualitative description of scientific images are both important to describe the complexity of digital image data. While various software solutions for quantitative measurements in images exist, there is a lack of simple tools for the qualitative description of images in common user-oriented image analysis software. To address this issue, we developed a set of Fiji plugins that facilitate the systematic manual annotation of images or image-regions. From a list of user-defined keywords, these plugins generate an easy-to-use graphical interface with buttons or checkboxes for the assignment of single or multiple pre-defined categories to full images or individual regions of interest. In addition to qualitative annotations, any quantitative measurement from the standard Fiji options can also be automatically reported. Besides the interactive user interface, keyboard shortcuts are available to speed-up the annotation process for larger datasets. The annotations are reported in a Fiji result table that can be exported as a pre-formatted csv file, for further analysis with common spreadsheet software or custom automated pipelines. To illustrate possible use case of the annotations, and facilitate the analysis of the generated annotations, we provide examples of such pipelines, including data-visualization solutions in Fiji and KNIME, as well as a complete workflow for training and application of a deep learning model for image classification in KNIME.

34035550,1,"In 2017, ovarian cancer due to asbestos exposure was designated a new, and thereby the first, gynaecological occupational disease in Germany. Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral fibre with an annual usage in Germany of 160 000 - 180 000 metric tonnes in the 1960s and 1970s. The carcinogenicity of asbestos for the target organs lungs, larynx, pleura including pericardium, and peritoneum including tunica vaginalis testis has been clearly established for many years. Recent meta-analyses of data from cohort studies have demonstrated that the risk of ovarian cancer roughly doubles in women with occupational exposure to asbestos. Since the group of people with double the risk of developing lung cancer due to work-related asbestos exposure has a 2.25-fold increased risk of mortality from ovarian cancer on average, work-related ovarian cancer has been assigned the same recognition requirements as in occupational lung (and laryngeal) cancer. Thus, gynaecologists must obtain a thorough history of occupational exposure to asbestos, even if it may have taken place long in the past.

The analysis was based on data from the population-based KORA Myocardial Infarction Registry located in the region of Augsburg, Germany. All cases of AMI (n = 210) admitted to one of four hospitals in the city of Augsburg or the county of Augsburg from February 10th, 2020, to May 19, 2020, were included. Patients were divided into three groups, namely pre-lockdown, strict lockdown, and attenuated lockdown period. An additional survey was conducted asking the patients for stress and fears in the 4 weeks prior to their AMI. The AMI rate declined by 44% in the strict lockdown period; in the attenuated lockdown period the rate was 17% lower compared to the pre-lockdown period. The downward trend in AMI rates during lockdown was seen in STEMI and NSTEMI patients, and independent of sex and age. The door-to-device time decreased by 70-80% in the lockdown-periods. In the time prior to the infarction, patients felt stressed mainly due to fear of infection with Sars-CoV-2 and less because of the restrictions and consequences of the lockdown. A strict lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic had a marked impact on AMI care even in a non-hot-spot region with relatively few cases of COVID-19. Fear of infection with the virus is presumably the main reason for the drop in hospitalizations due to AMI.",NA,NA,NA

34145241,1,"Atherosclerosis is a major underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. Previous studies showed that inhibition of the co-stimulatory CD40 ligand (CD40L)-CD40 signaling axis profoundly attenuates atherosclerosis. As CD40L exerts multiple functions depending on the cell-cell interactions involved, we sought to investigate the function of the most relevant CD40L-expressing cell types in atherosclerosis: T cells and platelets. Atherosclerosis-prone mice with a CD40L-deficiency in CD4+ T cells display impaired Th1 polarization, as reflected by reduced interferon-γ production, and smaller atherosclerotic plaques containing fewer T-cells, smaller necrotic cores, an increased number of smooth muscle cells and thicker fibrous caps. Mice with a corresponding CD40-deficiency in CD11c+ dendritic cells phenocopy these findings, suggesting that the T cell-dendritic cell CD40L-CD40 axis is crucial in atherogenesis. Accordingly, sCD40L/sCD40 and interferon-γ concentrations in carotid plaques and plasma are positively correlated in patients with cerebrovascular disease. Platelet-specific deficiency of CD40L does not affect atherogenesis but ameliorates atherothrombosis.

Men were significantly more likely to require help completing the questionnaires than women (inv.OR= 0.51, 95% CI=(0.27, 0.95), p = 0.035). The level of help needed increased by 3% with each 1-year increase in age (inv. OR=1.03, 95% CI=(1.01, 1.06), p = 0.013). On average, a patient tended to declare weight which was 0.84 kg inferior to their true weight (Bland and Altman 95 % CI=(-3.9, 5.6); SD: 2.41) and a height which was 0.95 cm superior to their true height (Bland and Altman 95 % CI=(-5, 3.1); SD 2.08).

34498316,1,"Neuroimaging studies suggest that intranasal oxytocin (IN-OXT) may modulate emotional and social processes by altering neural activity patterns. The extent of brain penetration after IN-OXT is unclear, and it is currently unknown whether IN-OXT can directly bind central oxytocin receptors (OXTRs). We investigated oxytocin pathway gene expression in regions affected by IN-OXT on task-based fMRI. We found that OXTR is more highly expressed in affected than unaffected subcortical regions; this effect did not vary by task type or sex. Cortical results revealed higher OXTR expression in regions affected by IN-OXT in emotional processing tasks and in male-only data. No significant differences were found in expression of the closely related vasopressin receptors. Our findings suggest that the mechanism by which IN-OXT may alter brain functionality involves direct activation of central OXTRs.",NA,NA,NA

34739220,1,"Monoclonal antibody (mAb) pharmaceuticals consist of a plethora of different proteoforms with different functional characteristics, including pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, requiring their individual assessment. Current binding techniques do not distinguish between coexisting proteoforms requiring tedious production of enriched proteoforms. Here, we have developed an approach based on mobility shift-affinity capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (ACE-MS), which permitted us to determine the binding of coexisting mAb proteoforms to Fc receptors (FcRs). For high-sensitivity MS analysis, we used a sheathless interface providing adequate mAb sensitivity allowing functional characterization of mAbs with a high sensitivity and dynamic range. As a model system, we focused on the interaction with the neonatal FcR (FcRn), which determines the half-life of mAbs. Depending on the oxidation status, proteoforms exhibited different electrophoretic mobility shifts in the presence of FcRn, which could be used to determine their affinity. We confirmed the decrease of the FcRn affinity with antibody oxidation and observed a minor glycosylation effect, with higher affinities for galactosylated glycoforms. Next to relative binding, the approach permits the determination of individual KD values in solution resulting in values of 422 and 139 nM for double-oxidized and non-oxidized variants. Hyphenation with native MS provides unique capabilities for simultaneous heterogeneity assessment for mAbs, FcRn, and complexes formed. The latter provides information on binding stoichiometry revealing 1:1 and 1:2 for antibody/FcRn complexes. The use of differently engineered Fc-only constructs allowed distinguishing between symmetric and asymmetric binding. The approach opens up unique possibilities for proteoform-resolved antibody binding studies to FcRn and can be extended to other FcRs and protein interactions.",NA,NA,NA
34777319,1,"Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae with tropism for skin and peripheral nerves. Incessant transmission in endemic areas is still impeding elimination of leprosy. Although detection of M. leprae infection remains a challenge in asymptomatic individuals, the presence of antibodies specific for phenolglycolipid-I (PGL-I) correlate with bacterial load. Therefore, serosurveillance utilizing field-friendly tests detecting anti-PGL-I antibodies, can be applied to identify those who may transmit bacteria and to study (reduction of) M. leprae transmission. However, serology based on antibody detection cannot discriminate between past and present M. leprae infection in humans, nor can it detect individuals carrying low bacillary loads. In humans, anti-PGL-I IgM levels are long-lasting and usually detected in more individuals than anti-PGL-I IgG levels. Inherent to the characteristically long incubation time of leprosy, IgM/IgG relations (antibody kinetics) in leprosy patients and infected individuals are not completely clear. To investigate the antibody response directly after infection, we have measured antibody levels by ELISA, in longitudinal samples of experimentally M. leprae infected, susceptible nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus). In addition, we assessed the user- and field-friendly, low-cost lateral flow assay (LFA) utilizing upconverting reporter particles (UCP), developed for quantitative detection of human anti-PGL-I IgM (UCP-LFA), to detect treatment- or vaccination-induced changes in viable bacterial load. Our results show that serum levels of anti-PGL-I IgM, and to a lesser extent IgG, significantly increase soon after experimental M. leprae infection in armadillos. In view of leprosy phenotypes in armadillos, this animal model can provide useful insight into antibody kinetics in early infection in the various spectral forms of human leprosy. The UCP-LFA for quantitative detection of anti-PGL-I IgM allows monitoring the efficacy of vaccination and rifampin-treatment in the armadillo leprosy model, thereby providing a convenient tool to evaluate the effects of drugs and vaccines and new diagnostics.",NA,NA,NA

A parabolic relation was observed for mortality, with the lowest risk for eGFR15-16. Compared with dialysis initiation at eGFR6-7, initiation at eGFR15-16 was associated with a 5.1% (95% confidence interval 2.5% to 6.9%) lower absolute five year mortality risk and 2.9% (0.2% to 5.5%) lower risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event, corresponding to hazard ratios of 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.87 to 0.92) and 0.94 (0.91 to 0.98), respectively. This 5.1% absolute risk difference corresponded to a mean postponement of death of 1.6 months over five years of follow-up. However, dialysis would need to be started four years earlier. When emulating the intended strategies of the Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) trial (eGFR10-14 v eGFR5-7) and the achieved eGFRs in IDEAL (eGFR7-10 v eGFR5-7), hazard ratios for all cause mortality were 0.96 (0.94 to 0.99) and 0.97 (0.94 to 1.00), respectively, which are congruent with the findings of the randomised IDEAL trial.",RESULTS,NA,NA

In patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), increased sensitivity of glucocorticoid negative feedback has regularly been observed. The single prolonged stress (SPS) paradigm was developed to model increased negative feedback and other aspects of PTSD in rats. In this study, we used a setup that precluded the evaluation of negative feedback but rather served to test the hypothesis of the enhanced glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling in higher brain areas. We injected corticosterone or vehicle 7 days after SPS and evaluated plasma corticosterone, as well as gene expression in the dorsal hippocampus and amygdala. We observed a strikingly rapid change in the expression of established GR target genes (t = 30 min) only in the SPS group on exogenous corticosterone injection. Our results extend the notion of increased GR sensitivity in PTSD to include transcriptional responses in the hippocampus.",NA,NA,NA
34880314,1,"Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes Hinge Domain Containing 1 (SMCHD1) is a chromatin repressor, which is mutated in > 95% of Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) type 2 cases. In FSHD2, SMCHD1 mutations ultimately result in the presence of the cleavage stage transcription factor DUX4 in muscle cells due to a failure in epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat on chromosome 4q, which contains the DUX4 locus. While binding of SMCHD1 to D4Z4 and its necessity to maintain a repressive D4Z4 chromatin structure in somatic cells are well documented, it is unclear how SMCHD1 is recruited to D4Z4, and how it exerts its repressive properties on chromatin. Here, we employ a quantitative proteomics approach to identify and characterize novel SMCHD1 interacting proteins, and assess their functionality in D4Z4 repression. We identify 28 robust SMCHD1 nuclear interactors, of which 12 are present in D4Z4 chromatin of myocytes. We demonstrate that loss of one of these SMCHD1 interacting proteins, RuvB-like 1 (RUVBL1), further derepresses DUX4 in FSHD myocytes. We also confirm the interaction of SMCHD1 with EZH inhibitory protein (EZHIP), a protein which prevents global H3K27me3 deposition by the Polycomb repressive complex PRC2, providing novel insights into the potential function of SMCHD1 in the repression of DUX4 in the early stages of embryogenesis. The SMCHD1 interactome outlined herein can thus provide further direction into research on the potential function of SMCHD1 at genomic loci where SMCHD1 is known to act, such as D4Z4 repeats, the inactive X chromosome, autosomal gene clusters, imprinted loci and telomeres.",NA,NA,NA
34898617,1,"For the control of COVID-19, vaccination programmes provide a long-term solution. The amount of available vaccines is often limited, and thus it is crucial to determine the allocation strategy. While mathematical modelling approaches have been used to find an optimal distribution of vaccines, there is an excessively large number of possible allocation schemes to be simulated. Here, we propose an algorithm to find a near-optimal allocation scheme given an intervention objective such as minimization of new infections, hospitalizations, or deaths, where multiple vaccines are available. The proposed principle for allocating vaccines is to target subgroups with the largest reduction in the outcome of interest. We use an approximation method to reconstruct the age-specific transmission intensity (the next generation matrix), and express the expected impact of vaccinating each subgroup in terms of the observed incidence of infection and force of infection. The proposed approach is firstly evaluated with a simulated epidemic and then applied to the epidemiological data on COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Our results reveal how the optimal allocation depends on the objective of infection control. In the case of COVID-19, if we wish to minimize deaths, the optimal allocation strategy is not efficient for minimizing other outcomes, such as infections. In simulated epidemics, an allocation strategy optimized for an outcome outperforms other strategies such as the allocation from young to old, from old to young, and at random. Our simulations clarify that the current policy in the Netherlands (i.e., allocation from old to young) was concordant with the allocation scheme that minimizes deaths. The proposed method provides an optimal allocation scheme, given routine surveillance data that reflect ongoing transmissions. This approach to allocation is useful for providing plausible simulation scenarios for complex models, which give a more robust basis to determine intervention strategies.",NA,NA,NA
34939259,1,"Glucocorticoid stress hormones are powerful modulators of brain function and can affect mood and cognitive processes. The hippocampus is a prominent glucocorticoid target and expresses both the glucocorticoid receptor (GR: Nr3c1) and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR: Nr3c2). These nuclear steroid receptors act as ligand-dependent transcription factors. Transcriptional effects of glucocorticoids have often been deduced from bulk mRNA measurements or spatially informed individual gene expression. However, only sparse data exists allowing insights on glucocorticoid-driven gene transcription at the cell type level. Here, we used publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data to assess the cell-type specificity of GR and MR signaling in the adult mouse hippocampus. The data confirmed that Nr3c1 and Nr3c2 expression differs across neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations. We analyzed co-expression with sex hormones receptors, transcriptional coregulators, and receptors for neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Our results provide insights in the cellular basis of previous bulk mRNA results and allow the formulation of more defined hypotheses on the effects of glucocorticoids on hippocampal function.",NA,NA,NA

Phosphoproteomes of embryonic stem cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) profiled by both methods achieved equivalent coverage (around 20,000 phosphosites), whereas a combined dataset significantly increased the depth (>30,000 phosphosites). While both methods reproducibly quantified a subset of shared IR-responsive phosphosites that represent DNA damage and cell-cycle-related signaling events, most IR-responsive phosphoproteins (>82%) and phosphosites (>96%) were method-specific. Both methods uncovered unique insights into phospho-signaling mediated by single (SCXPhos) versus double/multi-site (HighPhos) phosphorylation events; particularly, each method identified a distinct set of previously unreported IR-responsive kinome/phosphatome (95% disparate) directly impacting the uncovered biology.",NA,NA,NA
